<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">Essential Food</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Nothing can survive without food. Everything we consume acts either to heal us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or to poison us. We tend to think of nourishment only as what we take in through</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our mouths, but what we consume with our eyes, our ears, our noses, our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tongues, and our bodies is also food. The conversations going on around us, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">those we participate in, are also food. Are we consuming and creating the kind of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">food that is healthy for us and helps us grow?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we say something that nourishes us and uplifts the people around us,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we are feeding love and compassion. When we speak and act in a way that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">causes tension and anger, we are nourishing violence and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We often ingest toxic communication from those around us and from what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we watch and read. Are we ingesting things that grow our understanding and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion? If so, that’s good food. Often, we ingest communication that makes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us feel bad or insecure about ourselves or judgmental and superior to others. We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can think about our communication in terms of nourishment and consumption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The Internet is an item of consumption, full of nutrients that are both healing and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">toxic. It’s so easy to ingest a lot in just a few minutes online. This doesn’t mean</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you shouldn’t use the Internet, but you should be conscious of what you are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reading and watching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you work with your computer for three or four hours, you are totally</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">lost. It’s like eating french fries. You shouldn’t eat french fries all day, and you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">shouldn’t be on the computer all day. A few french fries, a few hours, are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">probably all most of us need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">What you read and write can help you heal, so be thoughtful about what you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">consume. When you write an e-mail or a letter that is full of understanding and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion, you are nourishing yourself during the time you write that letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Even if it’s just a short note, everything you’re writing down can nourish you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and the person to whom you are writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Consuming with Mindfulness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">How can you tell what communication is healthy and what is toxic? The energy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of mindfulness is a necessary ingredient in healthy communication. Mindfulness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">requires letting go of judgment, returning to an awareness of the breath and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">body, and bringing your full attention to what is in you and around you. This</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">helps you notice whether the thought you just produced is healthy or unhealthy,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassionate or unkind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Conversation is a source of nourishment. We all get lonely and want to talk</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with someone. But when you have a conversation with another person, what that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person says may be full of toxins, like hate, anger, and frustration. When you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listen to what others say, you’re consuming those toxins. You’re bringing toxins</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">into your consciousness and your body. That’s why mindfulness of speaking and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness of listening are very important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Toxic conversation can be difficult to avoid, especially at work. If it is going</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">on around you, be aware. You need to have enough mindful awareness not to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">absorb these kinds of suffering. You have to protect yourself with the energy of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion so that when you listen, instead of consuming toxins, you’re actively</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">producing more compassion in yourself. When you listen in this way,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion protects you and the other person suffers less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You absorb the thoughts, speech, and actions you produce and those</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">contained in the communications of those around you. That is a form of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">consumption. So when you read something, when you listen to someone, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">should be careful not to allow the toxins to ruin your health and bring suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to you and to the other person or group of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">To illustrate this truth, the Buddha used the graphic image of a cow that has a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">skin disease. The cow is attacked by all kinds of insects and microorganisms</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">coming from the soil, coming from the trees, coming from the water. Without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">skin, a cow can’t protect herself. Mindfulness is our skin. Without mindfulness,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we may take in things that are toxic to our body and mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Even when you simply drive your car through the city, you consume. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">advertisements hit your eyes, and you’re forced to consume them. You hear</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sounds; you may even say things that are the products of too much toxic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">consumption. We have to protect ourselves with mindful consumption. Mindful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication is part of this. We can communicate in such a way as to solidify</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the peace and compassion in ourselves and bring joy to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Relationships Don’t Survive Without the Right Food</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many of us suffer because of difficult communication. We feel misunderstood,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">especially by those we love. In a relationship, we are nourishment for each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">So we have to select the kind of food we offer the other person, the kind of food</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that can help our relationships thrive. Everything—including love, hate, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering—needs food to continue. If suffering continues, it’s because we keep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">feeding our suffering. Every time we speak without mindful awareness, we are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">feeding our suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">With mindful awareness, we can look into the nature of our suffering and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">find out what kind of food we have been supplying to keep it alive. When we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">find the source of nourishment for our suffering, we can cut off that supply, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our suffering will fade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Often a romantic relationship begins beautifully, but then, because we don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know how to nourish our love, the relationship begins to die. Communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can bring it back to life. Every thought you produce in your head, in your heart</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">—in China they say, “in your belly”—feeds that relationship. When you produce</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a thought that carries suspicion, anger, fear, irritation, that thought is not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">nourishing to you or to the other person. If the relationship has become difficult,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it’s because we’ve nourished our judgment and our anger, and we haven’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">nourished our compassion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">One day in Plum Village, the French retreat center where I live, I gave a talk</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about how we needed to nourish our loved ones by practicing loving</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication. I spoke about our relationships as flowers that need watering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with love and communication to grow. There was a woman sitting near the front</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">who was crying the whole time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">After the talk, I went to her husband, and I said, “My dear friend, your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">flower needs some watering.” Her husband had been at the talk and knew about</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loving speech, but sometimes we all need a friend to remind us. So, after lunch,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the man took his wife for a drive in the country. They just had an hour or so but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">he focused on watering the good seeds the whole drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When they came back, she seemed completely transformed, very happy and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">joyful. Their children were very surprised, because in the morning when their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">parents had left, they’d been sad and irritable. So in just an hour, you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">transform another person and yourself, just with the practice of watering the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">good seeds. This is applied mindfulness in action; it’s not theoretical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Nourishing and healing communication is the food of our relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes one cruel utterance can make the other person suffer for many years,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and we will suffer for many years too. In a state of anger or fear, we may say</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something that can be poisonous and destructive. If we swallow poison, it can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">stay within us for a long time, slowly killing our relationship. We may not even</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know what we said or did that started to poison the relationship. But we have the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">antidote: mindful compassion and loving communication. Love, respect, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">friendship all need food to survive. With mindfulness we can produce thoughts,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech, and actions that will feed our relationships and help them grow and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">2</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">Communicating with Yourself</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Loneliness is the suffering of our time. Even if we’re surrounded by others, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can feel very alone. We are lonely together. There’s a vacuum inside us. It makes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us feel uncomfortable, so we try to fill it up by connecting with other people. We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">believe that if we’re able to connect, the feeling of loneliness will disappear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Technology supplies us with many devices to help us stay connected. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even when we’re connected, we continue to feel lonely. We check our e-mail,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">send text messages, and post updates several times a day. We want to share and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">receive. We might spend our whole day connecting but not reduce the loneliness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We all hunger for love, but we don’t know how to generate love in order to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">feed ourselves with it. When we’re empty, we use technology to try to dissipate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the feeling of loneliness, but it doesn’t work. We have the Internet, e-mail, video</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">conferencing, texting and posting, apps, letters, and cell phones. We have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">everything. And yet it’s not at all certain that we have improved our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many of us have cell phones. We want to be in touch with other people. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we shouldn’t put too much faith in our phones. I don’t have one, but I don’t feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out of touch with the world. In fact, without a mobile device, I have more time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">for myself and for others. You believe that having your phone helps you to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate. But if the content of your speech is not authentic, talking or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">texting on a device doesn’t mean you’re communicating with another person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We believe too much in the technologies of communication. Behind all these</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">instruments we have the mind, the most fundamental instrument for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication. If our minds are blocked, there is no device that will make up</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">for our inability to communicate with ourselves or others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Connecting Internally</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many of us spend a lot of time in meetings or e-mailing with others, and not a lot</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of time communicating with ourselves. The result is that we don’t know what is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">going on within us. It may be a mess inside. How, then, can we communicate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with another person?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We think that with all our technological devices we can connect, but this is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">an illusion. In daily life we’re disconnected from ourselves. We walk, but we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t know that we’re walking. We’re here, but we don’t know that we’re here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We’re alive, but we don’t know that we’re alive. Throughout the day, we lose</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">To stop and communicate with yourself is a revolutionary act. You sit down</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and stop that state of being lost, of not being yourself. You begin by just</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">stopping whatever you’re doing, sitting down, and connecting with yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This is called mindful awareness. Mindfulness is full awareness of the present</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">moment. You don’t need an iPhone or a computer. You just need to sit down and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breathe in and out. In just a few seconds, you can connect with yourself. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know what is going on in your body, your feelings, your emotions, and your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perceptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Digital Purpose</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you don’t feel you can communicate well in person or wonder if what you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say will be hard for the other person to hear, sometimes the best way to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate is to write a letter or an e-mail. If you can write a letter that’s full</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of understanding and compassion, then during the time of writing that letter you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will nourish yourself. Everything you write will be nourishing for the person you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">are writing to, and first of all for you. The other person hasn’t received the e-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mail or letter yet, but while typing the letter you are nourishing yourself, because</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">what you’re saying in the letter is full of compassion and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Especially at the beginning of your practice, it may be easier for you to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice mindful communication in writing. Writing this way is good for our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">health. We can send an e-mail, we can text, and we can talk on the phone and use</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindful communication. If our message is full of understanding and compassion,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we’ll be able to remove fear and anger from the other person. So next time you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hold the phone, look at it and remember that its purpose is to help you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate with compassion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Usually, we are in a hurry to send our e-mails and texts. As soon as we finish</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">writing them, we press send and they are gone. But there’s no need to rush. We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">always have time for at least one in-breath and out-breath before we pick up the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">phone or before we press send on a text or e-mail. If we do this, there is a much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">greater chance that we will be putting more compassionate communication out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">into the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Coming Home</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we begin to practice mindful awareness, we start the path home to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves. Home is the place where loneliness disappears. When we’re home, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">feel warm, comfortable, safe, fulfilled. We’ve gone away from our homes for a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">long time, and our homes have become neglected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But the path back home is not long. Home is inside us. Going home requires</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">only sitting down and being with yourself, accepting the situation as it is. Yes, it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">might be a mess in there, but we accept it because we know we have left home</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">for a long time. So now we’re home. With our in-breath and our out-breath, our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindful breathing, we begin to tidy up our homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Communicating with the Breath</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The path home begins with your breath. If you know how to breathe, you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">learn how to walk, how to sit, how to eat your meal, and how to work in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness so that you can begin to know yourself. When you breathe in, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">come back to yourself. When you breathe out, you release any tension. Once you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can communicate with yourself, you’ll be able to communicate outwardly with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more clarity. The way in is the way out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mindful breathing is a means of communication, just like a phone. It</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">promotes communication between the mind and the body. It helps us know what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we’re feeling. We’re breathing all the time, but we rarely pay attention to our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breath, unless our breathing is uncomfortable or restricted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">With mindful breathing, when we breathe in we know we’re breathing in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we breathe out we know we’re breathing out. When we breathe in, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bring our attention to our in-breath. To remind ourselves to pay attention to our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breath, we can say silently:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Breathing in, I know I’m breathing in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Breathing out, I know I’m breathing out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“The air is entering my body. The air is leaving my body.” Follow your in-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breath and out-breath all the way through. Suppose your in-breath lasts four</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">seconds. During the time of breathing in, allow your attention to rest entirely on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your in-breath, without interruption. During the time of breathing out, focus</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">entirely on your out-breath. You are with your in-breath and your out-breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You are not with anything else. You are your in-breath and your out-breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Breathing in and breathing out is a practice of freedom. When we focus our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">attention on our breath, we release everything else, including worries or fears</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about the future and regrets or sorrows about the past. Focusing on the breath,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we notice what we’re feeling in the present moment. We can do this throughout</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the day, enjoying the twenty-four hours that have been given us to breathe in and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out. We can be there for ourselves. It takes only a few seconds to breathe in and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">set yourself free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We know when others are breathing in and out mindfully; we can see it when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we look at them. They look free. If we’re overloaded with fear, anger, regret, or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anxiety, we’re not free, no matter what position we hold in society or how much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">money we have. Real freedom only comes when we’re able to release our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering and come home. Freedom is the most precious thing there is. It is the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">foundation of happiness, and it is available to us with each conscious breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Nonthinking and Nontalking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Happiness is possible when you’re in communication with yourself. To do this,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you have to leave your telephone behind. When you attend a meeting or an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">event, you turn off your telephone. Why? Because you want to communicate and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">absorb others’ communication. It is the same when communicating with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself. This kind of communication is not possible with the phone. We’re used</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to thinking a lot and talking a lot. But to communicate with ourselves, we need</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to practice nonthinking and nontalking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Nonthinking is a very important practice. Of course, thinking and talking can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be productive too, especially when our minds and feelings are clear. But a lot of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our thinking is caught up in dwelling on the past, trying to control the future,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">generating misperceptions, and worrying about what others are thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A misperception can happen in a moment, in a flash. As soon as we have a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perception, we’re caught by it. So anything we say or do based on that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perception can be dangerous. It’s better not to say or do anything! That’s why in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the Zen tradition they say the paths of talking and of thinking should be cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The path of speech is cut off because if you continue to talk, you continue to be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">caught in your words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mindful breathing is a practice of nonthinking and nontalking. Without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thinking and talking, there is no obstacle to get in the way of our enjoyment of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the present moment. It’s enjoyable to breathe in, to breathe out; it’s enjoyable to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sit, to walk, to eat breakfast, to take a shower, to clean the bathroom, to work in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the vegetable garden. When we stop talking and thinking and we listen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfully to ourselves, one thing we will notice is our greater capacity and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">opportunities for joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The other thing that happens when we stop thinking and talking and we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">begin listening to ourselves is that we notice the suffering present in our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There may be tension and pain in our bodies. We may have old pains and fears</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or new pains and fears, which we have hidden under our talking and texting and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mindfulness lets us listen to the pain, the sorrow, and the fear inside. When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we see that some suffering or some pain is coming up, we don’t try to run away</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">from it. In fact, we have to go back and take care of it. We’re not afraid of being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">overwhelmed, because we know how to breathe and how to walk so as to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">generate enough energy of mindfulness to recognize and take care of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. If you have enough mindfulness generated by the practice of mindful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breathing and walking, you’re no longer afraid to be with yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If I am free of needing a mobile phone, it’s because I carry mindfulness with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">me, like a guardian angel on my shoulder. The angel is always with me when I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice. It helps me be unafraid of whatever suffering or pain arises. It’s much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more important to keep your mindfulness with you than to keep your mobile</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">phone. You think that you’re safe when carrying your phone. But the truth is that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness will do much more than a phone to protect you, to help you suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">less, and to improve your communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Come Back</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The quiet of nonthinking and nontalking gives us the space to truly listen to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves. We don’t have to try to get away from our suffering. We don’t have to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cover up what is unpleasant in us. In fact, we try to be there for ourselves, to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand, so that we can transform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Please do come back home and listen. If you don’t communicate well with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, you cannot communicate well with another person. Come back again</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and again and communicate lovingly with yourself. That is the practice. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have to go back to yourself and listen to the happiness you may have in this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">moment; listen to the suffering in your body and in your mind, and learn how to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">embrace it and bring relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Communicating with the Body</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">As long as we have mindfulness with us, we can breathe mindfully throughout</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the day as we go about our daily activities. But our mindfulness will be stronger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and we’ll get more healing and communicate more successfully if we take the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time to pause and sit quietly for a few moments. When a newly freed Nelson</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mandela came to France for a visit, a journalist asked him what he would most</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">like to do. He said, “Sit down and do nothing.” Since his release from prison and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">his official entry into politics, he hadn’t had any time to just enjoy sitting. We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">should make time to sit, even if it’s for only a few minutes a day, because sitting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is a pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Whenever we’re restless and don’t know what to do, that is a good time to sit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">down. It’s good to sit when we’re peaceful too, as a way of nurturing a habit and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice of sitting. When we stop and sit, we can begin right away to follow our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in-breath and out-breath. Immediately, we can enjoy breathing in and breathing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out, and everything gets a little bit better because the present moment becomes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">available to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Breathe in a way that gives you pleasure. When you sit and breathe</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfully, your mind and body finally get to communicate and come together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This is a kind of miracle because usually the mind is in one place and the body</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in another. The mind is caught in the details of your projects to be done today,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your sorrow about the past, or your anxiety about the future. Your mind isn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anywhere near your body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you breathe in mindfully, there is a happy reunion between body and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mind. This doesn’t take any fancy technique. Just by sitting and breathing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfully, you’re bringing your mind home to your body. Your body is an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">essential part of your home. When you spend many hours with your computer,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you may forget entirely that you have a body until it’s too achy, stiff, or tense for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you to ignore. You need to take breaks and return to your body before it gets to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">To bring more awareness to the connection between body and mind, you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say to yourself:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Breathing in, I’m aware of my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Breathing out, I release all the tension in my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Take Yourself for a Walk</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mindful walking is a wonderful way to bring together body and mind. It also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">allows you the additional opportunity to communicate with something outside</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself that is nourishing and healing: the earth. When you take a step with full</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">awareness that you are taking a step on the ground and the earth, there is no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">distinction between body and mind. Your body is your breathing. Your body is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your feet. Your body is your lungs. And when you are connected with body, feet,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breath, and lungs, you are home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Every step brings you home to the here and the now, so you can connect with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, your body, and your feelings. That is a real connection. You don’t need</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a device that tells you how many friends you have or how many steps you’ve</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">walked or how many calories you’ve burned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you walk mindfully, integrate your breath with each step and focus on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your foot connecting with the ground. You’re aware that you’re making a step,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and you stop thinking altogether. When you think, you get lost in your thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You don’t know what’s going on in your body, in your feelings, or in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you think while you walk, you’re not really walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Instead, focus your attention on your breath and your step. Be aware of your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">foot, its movement, and the ground you’re touching. While you focus your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">attention on making the step, you are free, because in that time your mind is only</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with the step you are making. Your mind is no longer carried off into the future</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or the past. You take one step, and you are free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">While you walk, you can say to yourself, </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">I have arrived. I am home</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">. These</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">words are not a mere declaration or an affirmation practice. They are a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">realization. You don’t need to run anywhere. Many of us have run all our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Now we get to live life properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Home is the here and the now, where all the wonders of life are already</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">available, where the wonder that is your body is available. You can’t arrive fully</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in the here and the now unless you invest your whole body and mind into the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">present moment. If you haven’t arrived one hundred percent, stop where you are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and don’t take another step. Stay there and breathe until you’re sure you have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">arrived one hundred percent. Then you can smile a smile of victory. It’s probably</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">best to do that only when you are enjoying mindful walking alone; if you are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">around other people, you may create a traffic jam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You don’t need an app or an outsider to tell you whether you have arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You will know you have arrived because you will recognize that you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">comfortable being. When you walk from the parking lot to your office, go home</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in each step. Recover yourself and connect with yourself during every step. No</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">matter where you’re going, you can walk as a free person on this planet Earth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and enjoy every step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Walking on the Earth Heals Our Alienation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many of us live in a way that alienates us from the earth and from our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bodies. Most of us live very isolated from each other. We humans can get</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">extremely lonely. We’re separated not just from the earth and from each other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">but from our own selves. We spend many hours every day forgetting we have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bodies. But if we begin to practice breathing mindfully and listening to the body,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we can also begin to look deeply and see that the earth is all around us. We touch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the earth, and we are no longer alienated from our own bodies or from the body</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We commonly think of the earth as our “environment,” but looking more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deeply, we see that the earth is a wonderful living reality. Often, when we feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">alone, we forget that we can connect directly with the earth. When we bring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness to our steps, these steps can bring us back in touch with our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bodies and with the body of the earth. These steps can rescue us from our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">alienation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Connecting to Our Suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we begin to breathe mindfully and listen to our bodies, we become aware</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of feelings of suffering that we’ve been ignoring. We hold these feelings in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bodies as well as our minds. Our suffering has been trying to communicate with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us, to let us know it is there, but we have spent a lot of time and energy ignoring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we begin breathing mindfully, feelings of loneliness, sadness, fear, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anxiety may come up. When that happens, we don’t need to do anything right</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">away. We can just continue to follow our in-breath and our out-breath. We don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tell our fear to go away; we recognize it. We don’t tell our anger to go away; we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">acknowledge it. These feelings are like a small child tugging at our sleeves. Pick</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">them up and hold them tenderly. Acknowledging our feelings without judging</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">them or pushing them away, embracing them with mindfulness, is an act of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">homecoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Suffering of Our Ancestors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We know that the suffering inside us contains the suffering of our fathers, our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mothers, and our ancestors. Our ancestors may not have had a chance to get in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">touch with the practice of mindfulness, which could help them transform their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. That is why they have transmitted their unresolved suffering to us. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we are able to understand that suffering and thereby transform it, we are healing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our parents and our ancestors as well as ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Our suffering reflects the suffering of the world. Discrimination,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">exploitation, poverty, and fear cause a lot of suffering in those around us. Our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering also reflects the suffering of others. We may be motivated by the desire</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to do something to help relieve the suffering in the world. How can we do that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">without understanding the nature of suffering? If we understand our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering, it will become much easier for us to understand the suffering of others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and of the world. We may have the intention to do something or be someone that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can help the world suffer less, but unless we can listen to and acknowledge our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">own suffering, we will not really be able to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Listening Deeply</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The amount of suffering inside us and around us can be overwhelming. Usually</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we don’t like to be in touch with it because we believe it’s unpleasant. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">marketplace provides us with everything imaginable to help us run away from</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves. We consume all these products in order to ignore and cover up the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering in us. Even if we’re not hungry, we eat. When we watch television,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even if the program isn’t very good, we don’t have the courage to turn it off,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">because we know that when we turn it off we may have to go back to ourselves</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and get in touch with the suffering inside. We consume not because we need to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">consume but because we’re afraid of encountering the suffering inside us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But there is a way of getting in touch with the suffering without being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">overwhelmed by it. We try to avoid suffering, but suffering is useful. We </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">need</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. Going back to listen and understand our suffering brings about the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">birth of compassion and love. If we take the time to listen deeply to our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering, we will be able to understand it. Any suffering that has not been</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">released and reconciled will continue. Until it has been understood and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">transformed, we carry with us not just our own suffering but also that of our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">parents and our ancestors. Getting in touch with the suffering that has been</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">passed down to us helps us understand our own suffering. Understanding</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering gives rise to compassion. Love is born, and right away we suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If we understand the nature and the roots of our suffering, the path leading to the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cessation of the suffering will appear in front of us. Knowing there is a way out,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a path, brings us relief, and we no longer need to be afraid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Suffering Brings Happiness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Understanding suffering always brings compassion. If we don’t understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering, we don’t understand happiness. If we know how to take good care of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering, we will know how to take good care of happiness. We need suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to grow happiness. The fact is that suffering and happiness always go together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we understand suffering, we will understand happiness. If we know how</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to handle suffering, we will know how to handle happiness and produce</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If a lotus is to grow, it needs to be rooted in the mud. Compassion is born</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">from understanding suffering. We all should learn to embrace our own suffering,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to listen to it deeply, and to have a deep look into its nature. In doing so, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">allow the energy of love and compassion to be born. When the energy of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion is born, right away we suffer less. When we suffer less, when we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have compassion for ourselves, we can more easily understand the suffering of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">another person and of the world. Then our communication with others will be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">based on the desire to understand rather than the desire to prove ourselves right</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or make ourselves feel better. We will have only the intention to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Understanding Our Own Suffering Helps Us Understand Others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I know a woman from Washington, D.C., who at one time planned to commit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suicide because she couldn’t see any way out of the suffering she was feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">She had no hope. She had a very difficult relationship with her husband, and also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with their three children. She had a friend who wanted her to listen to one of my</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">talks on deep listening and loving speech. She refused because she was Catholic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and she thought that listening to a Buddhist teaching meant she wasn’t being true</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to her faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">On the night she planned to kill herself, she telephoned her friend to say</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">good-bye. Her friend said, “Before you kill yourself, come say good-bye to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Take a taxi.” She came, and when she got there, her friend asked her, as a favor,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to listen to the tape before she killed herself. Reluctantly she said, “All right,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">before dying I’ll satisfy your wish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">After listening to the tape, she was curious and decided to go to a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness retreat. At the retreat, she began to really listen to her own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. Before that, she had thought the only way to end her suffering was to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">kill herself. It was too painful to listen. But she learned how to stay with her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breath so she could be with her suffering. She found that she had created a lot of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">wrong perceptions and had nurtured a lot of anger. She had thought that her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">husband and her family had created all her suffering, but now she saw that she</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">was co-responsible for her suffering. She had thought that her husband didn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffer, that he just made her suffer. But now her understanding was quite</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">different, and she was able to see the suffering in her husband. This was quite an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">achievement. When you see the suffering inside yourself, you can see the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering in the other person, and you can see your part, your responsibility, in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">creating the suffering in yourself and in the other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The night when she came back from the retreat, she came and sat close to her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">husband. This was something very new, coming and sitting near him. She sat for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a long time, and then she began to talk. She said, “I know you have suffered so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">much during the past many years. I couldn’t help you. I made the situation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">worse. It wasn’t my intention to make you suffer. It was just because I didn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand you. I didn’t see the suffering inside you. Tell me about your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">difficulties. Please help me understand.” She was able to use this kind of loving</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech. Her husband began to cry like a baby, because for so many years she</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hadn’t talked to him in a loving way. Their relationship had been very beautiful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in the beginning. But it had become filled with resentment and arguments and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">lacked any real communication. That night began their journey to reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Two weeks later, the couple came with their children to tell me this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Loving Yourself Is the Basis for Compassion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We tend to think we already know and understand our loved ones very well, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that may not be so. If we haven’t understood our own suffering and our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perceptions, how can we understand the suffering of another person? We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">shouldn’t be too sure that we understand everything about the other person. We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have to ask, “Do I understand myself enough? Do I understand my suffering and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">its roots?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Once you have some understanding and insight into your own suffering, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">begin to be better at understanding and communicating with someone else. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you can’t accept yourself—if you hate yourself and get angry with yourself—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">how can you love another person and communicate love to him or her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Self-understanding is crucial for understanding another person; self-love is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">crucial for loving others. When you’ve understood your suffering, you suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">less, and you are capable of understanding another person’s suffering much more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">easily. When you can recognize the suffering in the other person and see how</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that suffering came about, compassion arises. You no longer have the desire to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">punish or blame the other person. You can listen deeply, and when you speak</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">there is compassion and understanding in your speech. The person with whom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re speaking will feel much more comfortable, because there is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding and love in your voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Coming home to ourselves to understand our suffering and its roots is the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">first step. Once we understand our suffering and how it came about, we’re in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">position to communicate with others in such a way that they also suffer less. Our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relationships depend on the capacity of each of us to understand our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">difficulties and aspirations and those of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you can truly come home to yourself and listen to yourself, you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">profit from every moment given you to live. You can enjoy every moment. With</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">good internal communication facilitated by mindful breathing, you can begin to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand yourself, understand your suffering, and understand your happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Knowing how to handle suffering, you know at the same time how to produce</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happiness. And if you’re truly happy, we all profit from your happiness. We need</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happy people in this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">The Keys to Communicating with Others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">As you connect with yourself, you begin connecting more deeply with other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">people. Without the first step, the second step isn’t possible. Don’t neglect to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reserve some time alone each day for communicating with yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">All of us still have misperceptions and suffering. When we communicate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with others, we should be aware that the suffering we have yet to heal and our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perceptions are also there. If we can be aware of our in-breath and out-breath, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will remember that the one goal of compassionate communication is to help</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">others suffer less. If we remember this, we’ve already succeeded. We’re already</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">contributing to more joy and less suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Saying Hello</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It’s helpful to remember at the beginning of every communication with another</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person that there is a Buddha inside each of us. “The Buddha” is just a name for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the most understanding and compassionate person it’s possible to be. You may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">call it something else if you wish, like wisdom or God. We can breathe, smile,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and walk in such a way that this person in us has a chance to manifest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Where I live in Plum Village, every time you meet someone on your way</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">somewhere, you join your palms and bow to him or to her with respect, because</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you know that there is a Buddha inside that person. Even if that person isn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">looking or acting like a Buddha, the capacity for love and compassion is in him</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or her. If you know how to bow with respect and freshness, you can help the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Buddha in him or her to come out. To join your palms and bow like this isn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mere ritual. It’s a practice of awakening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">While you bring your hands up and put your palms together, breathe in and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out mindfully. Your two hands form a flower, a lotus bud. If you do this with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">genuine intention, you will likely be able to see the possibilities in the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person. As you breathe, you may want to say silently:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A lotus for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A Buddha to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you join your palms, there should be concentration in you so you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not just going through the motions. The lotus flower of your hands is an offering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to the person in front of you. When you bow, you recognize the beauty in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In many Asian countries, when we meet each other we don’t shake hands</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">like in the West. We just join our palms and bow. About 160 years ago, the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">French came to Vietnam, and they taught us how to shake hands. In the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">beginning we thought it was funny to shake hands like that, but we learned quite</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">quickly. Now everyone knows how to shake hands, but we still like to join our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">palms and bow, especially in the temple. It may not be appropriate in your life or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">workplace for you to join your palms to everyone you see, but you can still look</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">them in the eye. As you smile, or say hello, or shake hands, in your mind you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can still be offering them a lotus flower, a reminder of the Buddha nature in both</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Two Keys to Compassionate Communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We communicate to be understood and to understand others. If we’re talking and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">no one is listening (maybe not even our own selves), we’re not communicating</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">effectively. There are two keys to effective and true communication. The first is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deep listening. The second is loving speech. Deep listening and loving speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">are the best instruments I know for establishing and restoring communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with others and relieving suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We all want to be understood. When we interact with another person,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">particularly if we haven’t practiced mindfulness of our own suffering and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listened well to our own selves, we’re anxious for others to understand us right</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">away. We want to begin by expressing ourselves. But talking first like that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">doesn’t usually work. Deep listening needs to come first. Practicing mindfulness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of suffering—recognizing and embracing the suffering in oneself and in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person—will give rise to the understanding necessary for good</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we listen to someone with the intention of helping that person suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">less, this is deep listening. When we listen with compassion, we don’t get caught</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in judgment. A judgment may form, but we don’t hold on to it. Deep listening</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">has the power to help us create a moment of joy, a moment of happiness, and to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">help us handle a painful emotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Now Is the Time to Listen Only</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Deep listening is a wonderful practice. If you can listen for thirty minutes with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion, you can help the other person suffer much less. If you don’t practice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness of compassion, you can’t listen long. Mindfulness of compassion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">means you listen with only one intention—to help the other person suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Your intention may be sincere, but if you haven’t first practiced listening to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, and you don’t practice mindfulness of compassion, you may rather</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">quickly lose your ability to listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The other person may say things that are full of wrong perceptions,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bitterness, accusation, and blaming. If we don’t practice mindfulness, their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">words will set off irritation, judgment, and anger in us, and we will lose our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">capacity to listen compassionately. When irritation or anger arises, we lose our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">capacity to listen. That’s why we have to practice, so that during the whole time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of listening, compassion can remain in our hearts. If we can keep our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion alive, the seeds of anger and judgment in our hearts will not be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">watered and spring up. We have to train ourselves first so we’re able to listen to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It is okay if you’re not ready to listen at a certain moment. If the quality of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your listening is not good enough, it’s better to pause and continue another day;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t push yourself too hard. Practice mindful breathing and mindful walking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">until you’re ready to really listen to the other person. You can say, “I want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listen to you when I’m at my best. Would it be all right if we continued</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Then, when we are ready to listen deeply, we can listen without interrupting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If we try to interrupt or correct the other person, we will transform the session</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">into a debate and it will ruin everything. After we have deeply listened and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">allowed the other person to express everything in his heart, we’ll have a chance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">later on to give him a little of the information he needs to correct his perception</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">—but not now. Now we just listen, even if the person says things that are wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It’s the practice of mindfulness of compassion that keeps us listening deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You have to take the time to look and see the suffering in the other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You must be prepared. Deep listening has only one purpose: to help others suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">less. Even if the person says wrong things, expresses bitterness, or blames,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">continue to listen compassionately for as long as you can. You may want to say</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">this to yourself as a reminder:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I am listening to this person with only one purpose: to give this person a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">chance to suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Keep the one purpose of deep listening alive in your heart and in your mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">As long as you are inhabited by the energy of compassion, you are safe. Even if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">what the other person says contains a lot of wrong perceptions, bitterness, anger,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">blame, and accusation, you are really safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Remember that the other person’s speech may be based on prejudices and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">misunderstandings. You will have a chance later to offer some information so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that he or she can correct his or her perception, but not now. Now is the time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">only to listen. If you can keep your mindfulness of compassion alive for even</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thirty minutes, you are inhabited by the energy of compassion and you are safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">As long as compassion is present, you can listen with equanimity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You know that the other person is suffering. When we don’t know how to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">handle the suffering inside us, we continue to suffer, and we make people around</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us suffer. When other people don’t know how to handle their suffering, they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">become its victim. If you imbibe their judgment, fear, and anger, you become its</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">second victim. But if you can listen deeply, understanding that what they are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">saying is coming from suffering, then you are protected by your compassion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You only want to help them suffer less. You don’t blame or judge them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Love Is Born from Understanding</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Listening deeply and compassionately, you begin to understand the other person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more fully, and love is nourished. The foundation of love is understanding, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that means first of all understanding suffering. Each of us is hungry for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding. If you really want to love someone and make him or her happy,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you have to understand that person’s suffering. With understanding, your love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will deepen and become true love. Listening to suffering is an essential</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ingredient for generating understanding and love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I define happiness as the capacity to understand and to love, because without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding and love no happiness could be possible. We don’t have enough</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding and love, which is why we suffer so much. That is what we are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thirsting for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Compassion and love are born from understanding. How can you love unless</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you understand? How can the father love his son if he doesn’t understand the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering and difficulties of his son? How can someone make his beloved happy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">without knowing anything about that person’s suffering and difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Do I Understand You Enough?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you want to make someone happy, you should ask yourself the question “Do I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand him enough?” “Do I understand her enough?” Many people are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reluctant to talk because they fear that what they say will be misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There are people who suffer so much; they’re not capable of telling us about the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering inside. And we have the impression that nothing is wrong—until it’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Waiting has serious consequences. People may isolate themselves, they may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suddenly end a friendship or relationship, and they may even commit suicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Something had been bothering that person for a long time, but he or she</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">pretended that everything was okay. Maybe fear or pride gets in the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Listening and looking with mindfulness and concentration, we may discover that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">there’s a block of suffering in that person. We see that she has suffered so much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and doesn’t know how to handle the suffering inside. So she continues to suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and make other people suffer, too. Once you have seen that, suddenly your anger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is no longer there. Compassion arises. You have the insight that she is suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and needs help, not punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you need to, you can ask for help. You can say, “Dear One, I want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand you more. I want to understand your difficulties and your suffering. I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">want to listen to you because I want to love you.” When we take the time to look</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more deeply, we may see for the first time the big block of suffering in that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person. Someone might pretend not to suffer, but that’s not true. When you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">able to listen compassionately, other people have a chance to tell you about their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In any relationship, you may want to check whether you have understood the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person. If it is a relationship that is harmonious, in which communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is good, then happiness is there. If communication and harmony exist, it means</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mutual understanding is there. Don’t wait until the other person has left or is full</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of anger to ask the important question “Do you think I understand you enough?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The other person will tell you if you haven’t understood enough. He will know if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re able to listen with compassion. You may say, “Please tell me, please help</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">me. Because I know very well that if I don’t understand you, I will make a lot of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mistakes.” That is the language of love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The question “Do you think I understand you enough?” is not just for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">romantic relationships, but for friends, family members, and anyone you care</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about. It can even help in a work setting. If you live with a family member, a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">romantic partner, or a friend, you may think that because you see this person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">every day you know a lot about him or her. But that’s not correct. You know only</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a little about that person. You may have lived with someone for five, ten, or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">twenty years. But you may not have looked deeply into that person to understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">him or her. You may have done the same with yourself. You have lived with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself your whole life. We think that we already understand who we are. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">unless we have listened deeply to ourselves, with compassion and curiosity and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">without judgment, we may not know ourselves very well at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you wait until family members pass away, it will be too late to ask them to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">share more about themselves. It’s nice when a child of any age sits with a parent</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and asks about their experiences, sufferings, and sources of happiness. Just sit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and listen. With mindful breathing and listening to ourselves, our capacity for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening and looking expands deeply, and we may find the opportunity for much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">greater communication and connection with our parents and our loved ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you see that the other person has suffering inside, compassion is born</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in your heart. You may want to do something to help that person suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Your compassionate listening and loving speech will already do a lot to change</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the situation. Then you can sit with the person and together get insight into what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other concrete actions, if any, are necessary to help the situation. Compassionate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening isn’t the only thing we can do when someone is suffering, but it’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">almost always the first step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Loving Speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you have to tell people bad news, telling the truth can be difficult. If you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t speak mindfully, the other person can get very angry or anxious after</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hearing your “truth.” We can train ourselves to speak the truth in such a way</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that, in the end, the other person can accept it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you speak, you try to tell others the truth about your suffering and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">their suffering, this is loving speech. You speak in a way that helps others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">recognize the suffering inside themselves and in you. We have to be skillful. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">one who speaks has to be very mindful, using words in a way that can help the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listener not be caught in wrong perceptions. And the listener has to be careful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not to be caught in the words being said or the ideas being offered. There needs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to be mindfulness and skillfulness on the part of both the speaker and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listener.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Because you have first practiced compassionate listening, you know that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">what you say can carry with it insight and understanding. With more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding, you can really help the other person suffer less, and your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication is more effective. You speak gently because you are willing to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">help. The way we communicate already makes the other person feel much better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The words we say are nourishment. We can use words that will nourish</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves and nourish another person. What you say, what you write, should</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">convey only compassion and understanding. Your words can inspire confidence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and openness in another person. Generosity can be practiced wonderfully with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loving speech. You don’t have to spend any money to practice generosity. In</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Buddhism another way of saying loving speech is Right Speech. In our daily</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">life, Right Speech is what nourishes us and nourishes those around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Wrong Speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We call loving speech “Right Speech” because we know that suffering is brought</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about by wrong speech. Our speech can cause a lot of suffering with unkind,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">untruthful, or violent words. Wrong speech is the kind of speech that lacks</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">openness and does not have understanding, compassion, and reconciliation at its</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we write a note or a letter, when we speak on the telephone, what we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">write or say should be Right Speech that conveys our insight, our understanding,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and our compassion. When we practice Right Speech, we feel wonderful in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bodies and our minds. And the one who listens to us also feels wonderful. It’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">possible for us to use Right Speech, the speech of compassion, tolerance, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">forgiveness, several times a day. It doesn’t cost anything and it’s very healing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Four Elements of Right Speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Loving, truthful speech can bring a lot of joy and peace to people. But producing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loving speech takes practice because we aren’t used to it. When we hear so much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech that causes craving, insecurity, and anger, we get accustomed to speaking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that way. Truthful, loving speech is something we need to train ourselves in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In Buddhism there’s a practice called the Ten Bodhisattva Trainings. Four of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">these ten relate to Right Speech. A bodhisattva is an enlightened being who has</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">dedicated his or her life to alleviating the suffering of all living beings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Enlightenment is always enlightenment about something. If you begin to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand the nature and the root of your suffering, that is a kind of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enlightenment, and it helps you suffer less right away. There are those of us who</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">are very critical of ourselves. That’s because we haven’t understood our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. When we become a bodhisattva for ourselves, we don’t blame</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves or others anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A bodhisattva is someone who can speak with gentle, loving speech and who</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can listen with compassion. Anyone can become a bodhisattva by training</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">diligently. You don’t have to practice for ten years to become a bodhisattva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Spend at least some time each day, even if it’s only five or ten minutes, sitting,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practicing mindful breathing, and listening to yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Here are the four bodhisattva guidelines of the Ten Bodhisattva Trainings for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Right Speech:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">1. Tell the truth. Don’t lie or turn the truth upside down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">2. Don’t exaggerate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">3. Be consistent. This means no double-talk: speaking about something in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">one way to one person and in an opposite way to another for selfish or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">manipulative reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">4. Use peaceful language. Don’t use insulting or violent words, cruel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech, verbal abuse, or condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Tell the Truth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The first element of Right Speech is to tell the truth. We don’t lie. We try not to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say untruthful things. If we think the truth is too shocking, we find a skillful and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loving way to tell the truth. But we have to respect the truth. There are those who</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">verbally abuse people and make them suffer, and then say, “I’m only telling the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">truth.” But they tell the “truth” in a violent and attacking way. Sometimes it can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even cause the other person to feel great suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you tell the truth, sometimes the result isn’t what you wanted. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">need to look deep into the mind of the other person to see how you can tell the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">truth in such a way that others don’t feel threatened, so they can listen. You try to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tell the truth in a loving and protective way. It’s important to remember that what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you think is the truth could be your own incomplete or erroneous perception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You think it’s the truth, but your perception may be partial; it may be blocked by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Lying is dangerous, because one day the other person may find out the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">That could be a catastrophe. So if we don’t want to lie, and we don’t want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">trigger a hurt, we have to be mindful of our words and find a skillful means to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tell the truth. There are many ways to tell the truth. It’s an art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The truth is a solid base for a long-lasting relationship. If you don’t build</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your relationship on the truth, sooner or later it will crumble. We have to find the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">best way to tell the truth so that the other person can receive it easily. Sometimes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even the most skillful words can cause pain. That is okay. Pain can heal. If your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">words are spoken with compassion and understanding, the pain will heal more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Suffering can be beneficial. There can be goodness in suffering, but we don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">want to make the other person suffer needlessly. We can minimize the shock and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the pain. We try to convey the truth in such a way that other people can hear us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">without suffering too much. The important thing is that they feel safe. They may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not “get it,” or it may take time for them to “get it.” They may continue to have a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">different perception than ours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes you can begin by telling another story, the story of someone else</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">whose situation is similar to the person you are speaking to, so that he or she can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">get accustomed to the idea. It’s easier to listen to the story of another person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You can say, “What do you think? Would it be good for the other person to hear</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the truth or not?” Usually people say, “Yes, it’s good to hear the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes the person you are speaking to will come to the conclusion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">independently and learn from the case of the other person. It takes a lot of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice to tell the truth in a way that the other person can hear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Don’t Exaggerate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The second part of Right Speech is to refrain from inventing and exaggerating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You want to speak about some little thing, but you exaggerate and make it very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">big. For example, someone has made a mistake, but you exaggerate as though</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it’s something many times worse. Sometimes when we’re speaking to ourselves,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we make something seem very tragic to justify and even feed anger. There may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be some truth in what you want to say, but you exaggerate what the other person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">has done, so you paint a wrong image of the other. This may seem harmless, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it takes you away from the truth and takes away the trust in a relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Be Consistent</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The third kind of incorrect speech is what we call in Vietnamese “forked tongue”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or “double tongue.” It means you say something to one person, but when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speaking about the same matter to another person you say something different as</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a way of gaining some advantage. You speak about the same situation but in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">conflicting ways. This causes division and can make a person or group think</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">badly about the other person or group when there’s no basis for it. This can cause</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a lot of suffering on both sides and might even cause them to become enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Right Speech requires being true to your word and not changing the content for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your own advantage or to portray yourself in a better light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Use Peaceful Language</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The fourth aspect of Right Speech is to refrain from speech that’s violent,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">condemning, abusive, humiliating, accusing, or judgmental.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Four Criteria</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In the time of the Buddha, people were caught by mental constructions and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">interpreted the teachings in ways that were not intended by the teacher. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Buddha and his students came up with four criteria that should be contained in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">any teaching. These four criteria are helpful today in evaluating whether we and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">others are using Right Speech and speaking the truth effectively. The four</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">criteria are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">1. We have to speak the language of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">2. We may speak differently to different people, in a way that reflects</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">how they think and their ability to receive the teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">3. We give the right teaching according to person, time, and place, just as</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a doctor prescribes the right medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">4. We teach in a way that reflects the absolute truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">The First Criterion: Speak the Language of the World</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The first criterion is to understand the worldly way of seeing things, the worldly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">view. Sometimes we have to use the kind of language that people speak and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">way they view things. If you don’t use the language of the world, most people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">won’t understand what you mean, and you can communicate only with people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">who already think like you. This doesn’t mean you have to learn Vietnamese and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Arabic, but rather that you have to speak in terms that people can understand,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">based on their daily experience of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">For example, we are used to saying that the sky is “above” and the earth is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“below.” When we sit here, we say that what’s above us is “up” and what’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">below us is “down.” But for those who are sitting on the other side of the planet,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our down is their up, and our up is their down. What is up and down for this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">corner of the planet is not up and down for another part of the planet. So “up and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">down” is a truth, but it’s a relative truth. We can use it as part of our common</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">language, to communicate with each other, without needing to have an extended</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">discussion of “up” and “down” each time we talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">The Second Criterion: Speak According to the Understanding of the Person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Listening</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The second criterion says that we may have to speak to each person differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This doesn’t contradict the element of Right Speech that says not to speak with a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">forked tongue (doublespeak). We need to keep the truthful content the same</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">while being aware of the perspective and understanding of the person we’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speaking to, so others have an opportunity to really hear what’s being said. With</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">one person you speak one way; with another person you have to speak a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">different way. You have to look deeply at the person to see how he or she</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perceives, and speak in a way that takes that into account, so others can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand what you say. If someone’s understanding is profound, you speak in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">way that takes that into consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">One day someone asked the Buddha, “When that person passes away, which</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">heaven do you think he will go to?” The Buddha answered that he might be born</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">into this or that heavenly realm. Later another person asked the Buddha, “When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that person dies, where will he go?” The Buddha answered, “He will not go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anywhere.” Someone standing nearby asked the Buddha why he had given the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">two people two different answers. The Buddha replied that it depends on the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person who asks. He said, “I have to speak according to the mind of the person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">who listens and the ability of that person to receive what I share.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There’s a story of someone who gave a woman a pot of milk in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">At the end of the day, he came to get it back. During the day the milk had turned</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">into butter and cheese. The man said, “But I gave you milk, and you gave me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">back butter and cheese.” So is milk the same as or different from the butter? It’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not the same, but it’s not different either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">To those with more profound understanding, you have to give a deeper</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">answer, reflecting that nothing is permanent and everything is constantly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">changing. So the teaching you give and the way you speak depends on the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">degree of wisdom of the receiver and that person’s ability to understand what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you say. You speak according to the background and the abilities of the person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re speaking to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">The Third Criterion: Prescribe the Right Medicine for the Disease</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The third criterion is to prescribe the right medicine for the disease. If you give</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">someone the wrong medicine, that person could die. So to each you give a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">particular medicine. When you have attachment, craving, or despair, remember</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that you are your own teacher. You can listen to these strong emotions and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate back the healing you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Don’t think that if you hear or read something that inspires you, you should</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">then repeat it word for word. Think of how to make these truths you heard</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">resonate with your own. Similarly, you also have to know the mind and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">background of the person you’re speaking to. If you were to give another person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">exactly the teaching you heard, it might not be the appropriate teaching for that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person. You have to adapt what you say to the other’s background. But what you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say must also reflect the true teaching. So you use worldly language, but not just</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">any worldly language. Your language has to be appropriate to the situation, while</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not straying from the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Think about how we talk to children about death or violence in the world. Do</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we tell them the truth in a different way than we would an adult? One time when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I was visiting a museum, I entered a room containing a mummified human body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A little girl was there looking at the dead person. After we both had stood there</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">looking together for a while, with fear in her eyes she asked me something like,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“Am I going to be lying dead on a table one day?” I breathed in and out and gave</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">her the only answer that was appropriate for that situation: “No.” I hope that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">someday a wise parent or friend will be able to talk with her about the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">impermanence of all things, including our bodies </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">and</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> the deep teaching of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Buddha that nothing ever ceases to exist altogether, nothing goes from being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">existent to being nonexistent. But this was not the time or place for her to be told</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">all that, so I gave her the best answer available under the circumstances, which</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">was “no.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Even with adults, we can vary what we say depending on how fragile we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">think they might be about a certain subject. We want to share information in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">way that people can integrate and use later, even if not right away. This isn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">lying; it’s telling the truth in a skillful way. There was a man belonging to the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Jain tradition who asked the Buddha whether human beings have a self. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Buddha could have answered that there is no self, but he kept silent. Then the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Jain man asked, “Then do we have </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">no</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> self?” The Buddha still kept silent. Later</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Ananda asked the Buddha, “Why didn’t you say there is no self?” The Buddha</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">said, “I know that he is caught in his view. If I were to say that there is no self,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">he would be lost and he would suffer a lot. So although ‘no self’ is correct</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">according to our teaching, it was better to keep silent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">The Fourth Criterion: Reflect the Absolute Truth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The fourth criterion is the absolute truth, the most profound view of things, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it may be found in sentences such as “There is no separate self” or “There is no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">such thing as birth and death.” The absolute truth is correct; it is the closest thing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to a description of the ultimate reality, but it can make people feel lost if they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">haven’t had a spiritual teacher who could skillfully convey its depths to them, in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a way they could take in. So whenever we need to say something we know will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be difficult for others to hear, we have to be humble and try to look more and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more deeply to discover in what way we can talk about these things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There are some absolute truths, such as that of no-birth and no-death, that are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">very difficult to grasp in our everyday way of thinking and everyday lives. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">then if we are shown something simple, such as a cloud, we can grasp very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">easily that the cloud isn’t “born” and it doesn’t “die”; it simply changes form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We may think of these absolute truths as abstract, but they are visible all around</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us in the natural world if we look deeply or have a teacher or companion with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">whom we can talk about what we see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you use these four criteria, you will not be confused when you are reading or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening to something. They can also help you listen well to others and express</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself effectively in everyday life, whether in friendly conversation, when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speaking to or listening in a group, or when reading a text, whether secular or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">religious. You will have a deep understanding of what is the truth in any given</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">situation and how best to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This training isn’t just about how we speak but also goes along with how we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listen. So the focus is what happens not only with the mind and tongue, but also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with the ear. When we listen more deeply and see more clearly, compassion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">arises, and we use mindful speech that reflects our sincere and caring intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Instead of speaking cruelly, we begin to listen with compassion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we have the ability to listen with compassion to the suffering of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person, we will benefit as well. Our compassion makes us happy and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">peaceful. When we listen with compassion, we can understand things that we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">wouldn’t be able to understand if we were full of anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Listening deeply is a kind of looking deeply. You look not with your eyes but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with your ears. When you look with your eyes, you can see the suffering. When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you look with your ears, you can hear the vibration of that person’s words. In</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Vietnamese, the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara is called Quan The Am (in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Chinese, Kwan Yin). </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Quan</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> means to contemplate deeply; </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">the</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> means world; and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">am</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> means sound. Quan The Am listens to all the sounds, all the suffering of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">world. When you listen like that, compassion is born in you, and you can have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">peace. Please listen with great compassion. Even when you’re sad because of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bad news, your compassion will soothe your agitation and make you more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">peaceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Help People Understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">On my last trip to India, I was invited to be the guest editor for one day at the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Times of India</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">, the largest daily paper in India. It was during the Gandhi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">commemoration days in October 2008. One day I was sitting with the regular</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">editors in a meeting when news came in of a terrorist attack in Mumbai, near the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Pakistan border, in which a lot of people had been killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The editors asked me, “If you were a journalist in our time, how would you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">report when there is so much bad news and so little good news. How should we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be as journalists?” It’s a difficult question. Reporters have to report the news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But if journalists are writing only from the place of shock, fear, or outrage, they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will report in a way that waters the fear and anger of the reader, possibly creating</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more violence. So what can we do when we receive such news?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I didn’t answer right away. I went back to my in-breath and out-breath, and I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">kept silent for a time, and they kept silent too. Then I said, “You have to tell the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">truth. But you have to report in such a way that we don’t water the seeds of fear,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger, and vengeance in people. So you have to sit as a practitioner and look</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deeply, and ask, ‘Why would someone do violence to innocent people?’” When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’ve looked deeply, you will see that those who do violence have a wrong</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perception of the situation. They’re so sure their perception is the truth. And they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may think that if they also die in the explosion, they will go directly to heaven to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">join God.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Everybody wants to live; nobody wants to die. But they may think that by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">killing others and dying themselves they are doing the work of God. They think</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that those on the other side are the enemies of God. You can see that is wrong</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thinking, and so you have great compassion for them. For whoever has such a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">view, life is very dark and he suffers a lot. There are many wrong perceptions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">everywhere. So long as those wrong perceptions persist, the number of terrorists</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will only increase. It will be very difficult to find and control them all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If one terrorist group is violently destroyed, another will emerge; it’s endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">So I told the editors, “When you report on terrorist acts, use your compassion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and deep understanding. Explain the story in such a way that the reader doesn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">become enraged and perhaps become another terrorist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can tell the truth, but we must help people understand. When people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand, their anger will lessen. They don’t lose hope, they know what to do</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and what not to do, what to consume and what not to consume in order not to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">continue this kind of suffering. So my message that morning was that we should</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reflect and discuss events in a way that will not increase the despair and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger in people. Instead, we can help them to understand why things happen, so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">their insight and compassion increase. We can make a big difference with the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice of looking deeply. The solution isn’t to hide the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Using Right Speech in Daily Life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The four trainings in Right Speech remind us every day to use words that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">express nondiscrimination, forgiveness, understanding, support, and love. It’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">very liberating to be able to say or write something using compassionate speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Speaking in this way is as healing for the speaker as it is for the person being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">spoken to. These four trainings also remind us that anything we say which</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">contains poisons, discrimination, and hate will make us suffer and make others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffer. It’s a simple equation: wrong speech causes ill-being. Right Speech brings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about well-being and healing. Every day we can say something that has the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">capacity to heal and help people. A grown-up can do this. A child can do this. A</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">businessperson, a politician, or a teacher can do this. We don’t need to wait for a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">special moment. We can stop what we are doing right now and send an e-mail</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that contains Right Speech, and we can relieve the suffering inside us and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering in others right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">The Six Mantras of Loving Speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we have the impression that we’re all alone and nobody supports us, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can remember that it’s only a perception. It’s not accurate. Think of a tree</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">standing outside right now. The tree is supporting us with beauty, freshness, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">oxygen for us to breathe. That kind of support is also a kind of love. The fresh</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">air outside, the plants that feed us, and the water that flows over our hands from</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the tap all support us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There are many ways that people can support us and love us without actually</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">saying, “I love you.” You may know people who have never said, “I love you,”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">but you know they love you. When I was ordained as a novice monk, I had a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">teacher who I knew loved me deeply, but he never said, “I love you.” That is the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">traditional way. If one pronounced the words “I love you,” it seemed that some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of the sacredness was lost. Sometimes we feel very grateful, but we want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">express our gratefulness in ways other than simply saying, “thank you.” Look for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the many ways people communicate their love without saying it. Maybe, like the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tree, they are supporting you in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It’s also true that the people you love may not know you love them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes we want to tell someone how much we care, but we don’t know the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">words to say it so that person will understand how we feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The Six Mantras are six sentences that embody loving speech and let people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know that you see them, you understand them, and you care for them. In</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Buddhism we call these sentences “mantras.” They’re a kind of magic formula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you pronounce them, you can bring about a miracle, because happiness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">becomes available right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">As with each practice, you begin with mindful breathing to bring about your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">true presence. Then you come to the other person in mindfulness, committed to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the practice of compassionate communication. You may want to breathe in and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out three times before you say the mantra. We need those three breaths in and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out. This will make you calm, and your calm will be communicated to the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person. Then, when you go to another person, you know you will be fresh, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will have peace, and you can offer those things to the other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you want the mantra to work, you have to breathe in mindfully first and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">become fresh before you pronounce it. You look into the other person’s eyes, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you say these short sentences. A mantra may contain as few as four words, but in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">these words you are able to be fully there for the person you love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The First Mantra</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The first mantra is: “I am here for you.” This is the best gift you can give a loved</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">one. Nothing is more precious than your presence. No matter how expensive the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">things you buy for someone else, they’re not as precious as your true presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">That wonderful presence is fresh, solid, free, and calm, and you offer it to your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loved ones to increase their happiness and your own happiness. “I am here for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">To love someone means to be there for him or for her. To be there is an art</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and a practice. Are you truly there for the person you love, one hundred percent?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Using the skills of mindful breathing and mindful walking, you can bring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">together your body and mind to restore yourself and produce your true presence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in the here and the now. To be there like that, for yourself and for the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person, is an act of love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can also use this mantra with ourselves. When I say to myself, “I am here</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">for you,” it also means that I am there for myself. My mind goes home to my</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">body, and I become aware that I have a body. That is a practice of love, directed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to yourself. If you are capable of being with yourself, you are capable of being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with the person you love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The practice can be very pleasant. Breathing in and bringing your mind</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">home to your body can be a very pleasant thing to do. You enjoy your in-breath,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you enjoy your body, and you enjoy your mind. Then the mantra will have an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">effect on those around you too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You don’t need to wait for the practice to be reciprocated. The other person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">doesn’t need to say anything in return. When you produce the mantra, both of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you benefit. The mantra helps you and the other person come home to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourselves and to the moment you are sharing. So the effect is double.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We say that love is based on understanding. But how can you understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">someone if you aren’t present? Your mind has to be in the here and the now</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">before you can love. So the first definition of love is to be there. How can you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">love if you are not there? To love you have to be there. The tree outside your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">window is there, supporting you. You can be there for yourself and for your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loved ones, just like the tree. Mindfulness practice is the foundation of your love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You cannot love properly and deeply without mindfulness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Although you’re saying, “I am here for you,” the other person doesn’t have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to be there for you to practice the first mantra. If the other person is at home or at</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">work, you can use the phone. As you hold the phone in your hand, breathe in and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out a few times to make yourself present and calm. When you hear the phone</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ringing, you can continue your mindful breathing. When the other person picks</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">up the phone, you can ask if he or she has a moment. If so, you can just say: “I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">am here for you.” If you have practiced mindful breathing, the way you say the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mantra will convey your calm and your presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Second Mantra</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Don’t use the second mantra until you have practiced the first and produced your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">presence. Then, when you are truly there in the here and the now, you are in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">position to recognize the presence of the other person. The second mantra is: “I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know you are there, and I am very happy.” You are letting your loved one know</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that his or her presence is important to your happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The second mantra acknowledges that you really see the other person. This is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">crucial, because when a person ignores you, you don’t feel that you are loved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You may feel that the people you love are too busy to see you. Your loved one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may be driving the car and thinking of everything except you who are sitting in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the next seat. You don’t have that person’s attention. To love means to be aware</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of the presence of your beloved one and to recognize that presence as something</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">very precious to you. You use the energy of mindfulness to recognize and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">embrace the presence of your beloved one. Embraced by your mindfulness, the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person will bloom like a flower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“I know you are there, and I am very happy.” The second mantra is to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reaffirm the presence of the other person as someone very important to you. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">second mantra, like the first, only works if you breathe in and out before saying</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it. Imagine the other person is not there; he or she has moved away or passed on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You might feel a big hole. Right now that person is alive and near you, so you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">very lucky. That’s why you have to practice the second mantra to remind</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself of the gift of that person’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When someone says he loves you but he ignores your presence and doesn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">pay attention to your being there, you don’t have the feeling that you are loved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">So when you love someone you have to recognize his or her presence as</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something precious to you. The second mantra can be practiced every day,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">several times a day. “I know you are there, and it makes me very happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This mantra, like the first, can be shared anytime—before work, at the dinner</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">table, or over the phone or by e-mail if you want to share it with someone you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t get a chance to see. These mantras feel a bit awkward at first, while you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">getting used to them, but once you see the results, they will get easier. You can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">make yourself and the other person happy right away. It’s quicker than instant</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">coffee! But remember one thing: a mantra can be practiced successfully only if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you know how to make yourself present and say it in mindfulness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Third Mantra</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">While the first two mantras can be said several times a day, no matter what the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">situation, the third mantra is used when you notice that the other person is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. The third mantra can help the other person suffer less right away. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">third mantra is: “I know you suffer, and that is why I am here for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Thanks to your mindfulness, you know that something is not going well with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your friend or loved one. When your loved one is suffering, your impulse may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be to want to do something to fix it, but you don’t need to do much. You just</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">need to be there for him or her. That is true love. True love is made of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Because of your mindfulness, you know when something is not going well</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with a loved one. When you notice that, you want to do something to help him or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">her suffer less. You don’t have to do anything other than to be there. When you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say the mantra, right away your loved one will suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you suffer and your loved ones ignore your suffering, you suffer much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more. But if the other person is aware of your suffering and offers his presence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to you during those difficult moments, you suffer less right away. It doesn’t take</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">much time to bring relief. So please use this mantra in your relationship to help</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the other person suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Fourth Mantra</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The fourth mantra is a little more difficult, especially for those of us with a lot of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">pride. You use the fourth mantra when you suffer and you believe that the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person has caused your suffering. This happens from time to time. If it was</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">someone you didn’t care as much about who had said or done that to you, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">would have suffered less. But when someone you love says something that feels</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">critical or dismissive, you suffer deeply. If we suffer, and we don’t look deeply</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">into our suffering and find compassion for ourselves and the other person, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may want to punish the person who hurt us because he or she has dared to make</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us suffer. When we suffer, we think it’s the other person’s fault for not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">appreciating us enough or loving us enough. Many of us have a natural tendency</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to want to punish the other person. One way we think of punishing the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person is to show that we can survive without him or her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many of us have made this mistake. I myself have also made that mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But we learn. We want to show the other person that without him or her we can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">survive very well. This is an indirect way of saying, “I don’t need you.” But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that’s not true. In fact when we suffer, we need others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we suffer, we should tell others that we suffer and that we need their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">help. We usually do the opposite. We don’t want to go and ask for help. That’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">why we need the fourth mantra: “I suffer, please help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It’s so simple, and it’s also a little bit difficult. But if you can bring yourself</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to pronounce the mantra, right away you suffer less. I guarantee it. So please</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">write that sentence down on a piece of paper the size of a credit card and put it in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your wallet. It’s a magic formula: “I suffer. Please help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you don’t practice this mantra, you may be sulking; if others notice that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something is wrong, that maybe you suffer, they might try to comfort you and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say, “Are you suffering?” When someone asks you this, you might have the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tendency to respond, “Suffer? Why should I be suffering?” You know that’s not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the truth. You suffer deeply, yet you pretend you don’t suffer. You’re being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">untruthful as a way of punishing the other person. If he or she tries to come close</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and put a hand on your shoulder, you may want to snap, “Leave me alone. I can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">survive very well without you.” Many of us commit that kind of mistake. But we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Practicing the mantra, you do the opposite. You have to recognize that you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffer. The mantra can also be a little longer, if that feels more appropriate to the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">situation: “I suffer. I want you to know it. I don’t understand why you did or said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">what you did. So please explain. I need your help.” That is true love. To say, “I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t suffer; I don’t need your help” is not the language of true love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The next time you suffer, and you believe it’s the other person’s fault and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that she is the cause of your suffering, remember to take out the paper and read</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it, and you will know exactly what to do—practice the fourth mantra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">According to our practice in Plum Village, you have the right to suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">twenty-four hours but not more. There’s a deadline. The deadline is twenty-four</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hours, and you have to practice the fourth mantra before the deadline. You have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your phone. You have your computer. I’m sure that when you are able to bring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself to write it down, you will suffer less right away. If you aren’t calm</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enough within twenty-four hours to practice the fourth mantra, you can write it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">down on a piece of paper and leave it on the other person’s desk or somewhere it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is sure to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The mantra can be further broken down into three sentences. The first is: “I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffer and I want you to know.” That’s sharing yourself with the person you care</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about. You share your happiness with each other; you also need to share your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The second sentence is: “I am doing my best.” It means, “I am practicing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness, and when I get angry I won’t say anything that can cause damage</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to myself or to you. I am practicing mindful breathing, mindful walking, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">looking deeply into my suffering to find the roots of my suffering. I believe that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you have caused my suffering, but I know I shouldn’t be too sure about that. I’m</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">looking to see whether my suffering has come from a wrong perception on my</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">part. Maybe you didn’t mean to say it. Maybe you didn’t want to do it. I’m now</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">doing my best to practice looking deeply, to recognize my anger and embrace it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tenderly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The second sentence is an invitation for the other person to do the same, to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice like you are. When the other person gets the message, he might say to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">himself, “Oh, I didn’t know that she was suffering. What have I done or said to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">make her suffer like that?” It is an invitation for the other person to also practice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">looking deeply. If one of you finds out the cause, that person should</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate right away and apologize for being unskillful so that the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person doesn’t continue to suffer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">So the second sentence is an invitation for both sides to look deeply, to be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">aware of what is going on and investigate the real cause of the suffering. It’s a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">recognition that the other person is human and is doing his or her best at the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time, and that we are doing our best as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The third sentence is: “Please help.” This sentence acknowledges that we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can’t figure it all out on our own. We need each other. This is perhaps the hardest</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">part. The three sentences together are: “I suffer, and I want you to know it. I am</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">doing my best. Please help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Fifth Mantra</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The fifth mantra is: “This is a happy moment.” When you are with someone you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">care about, you can use this mantra. This is not autosuggestion or wishful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thinking, because there are conditions of happiness that are there. If we’re not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindful, we won’t recognize them. This mantra is to remind ourselves and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person that we are very lucky, that there are so many conditions of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happiness that are available in the here and the now. We can breathe easily. We</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have each other. We have the blue sky and the solidity of the whole earth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">supporting us. Sitting with the other person, walking together, you may want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">pronounce the fifth mantra and realize how lucky you are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Being able to recognize that this moment is a happy moment depends on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your mindfulness. These conditions of happiness are more than enough for both</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of you to be happy in the here and the now. It is mindfulness that makes the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">present moment into a wonderful moment. We can each learn how to bring</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happiness into the here and the now with our practice. What are we waiting for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to be happy? Why do we have to wait? With mindfulness you can recognize that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">is</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> possible to be happy right here and right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Sixth Mantra</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You use the sixth mantra when someone praises or criticizes you. You can use it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">equally well in both cases. The sixth mantra is: “You are partly right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I have weaknesses in me, and I have strengths in me. If you praise me, I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">shouldn’t get too puffed up and ignore the fact that in me there are also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">challenges. When you criticize me, I shouldn’t get lost in that and ignore the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">positive things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you see beautiful things in someone, you tend to overlook the things</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that are not so beautiful. But as human beings, we all have both positive and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">negative aspects. So when your loved one rhapsodizes about you, telling you that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you are the very image of perfection, you can say, “You are partly right. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know that I have other things in me too.” In this way you retain your humility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You don’t become the victim of a prideful illusion, because you know that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re not perfect. This is very important. When you pronounce the sixth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mantra, you preserve your humility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If the other person criticizes you, you can reply, “Darling, you are only partly</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">right, because I also have good things in me.” Without judgment, you investigate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">so you can improve. If somebody misjudges you, you reply, “You have said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something that is partly correct. But in me there are also positive things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Likewise, when someone admires you, you can thank them for appreciating you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">but also point out that they are seeing one part of you and that you have many</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">challenges too. “You have said something that’s only partly correct, because I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have many weaknesses that you perhaps haven’t seen yet.” If someone says,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“You have many weaknesses,” you can say, “You are partly correct. I have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">strengths too.” You may answer them that way in silence or say it nicely. “You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">are only seeing part of me, not the totality. I have other things in me that are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">much better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The sixth mantra is the truth. You don’t lie, and you don’t fall into false</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">humility. You just say it, either aloud or silently to yourself. Inside you there are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">many wonderful qualities and many weaknesses; you accept both. But that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">acceptance doesn’t prevent you from developing your positive qualities and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">addressing your weaknesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can use the same method when we look at other people. We can accept</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">others like we accept ourselves. We know that what they are expressing is only</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">part of them. Before judging and shouting at somebody, instead of telling</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">someone he or she has no value, we have to look deeper. I know people who are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">very sensitive. Even a slight judgment makes them weep and become very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">unhappy. Perhaps you also know people like this. So we accept ourselves with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">all our weaknesses, and then we have peace. We don’t judge ourselves; we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">accept. I have these qualities and these weaknesses, but I will try to improve</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">slowly, at my speed. If you can look at yourself like that, you can look at others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">like that too, without judgment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Even if that person has many weaknesses, he also has many talents, many</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">positive things. No one is without positive qualities. So when others judge you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">wrongly, you have to say that they are partly right but they have not seen the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other parts of you. The other person only sees part of you, not the totality, so you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t have to be unhappy at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can use these six mantras to make a close relationship stronger. My friend</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Elizabeth recently shared several ways in which she has used the mantras. Her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sister is one year older than she is. They were always together growing up, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">over the years and especially as they grew into young adults, Elizabeth had</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">gotten in the habit of lecturing her sister a little and telling her what to do. As</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you can imagine, sometimes her sister had strong reactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">With the practice of mindfulness, Elizabeth said, she became more aware of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">what she was saying, and she realized the importance of changing that habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When she visited her sister, she started practicing her version of the second</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mantra, saying: “I’m really happy that you’re here.” She got in touch with, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">expressed, a heartfelt appreciation of her sister’s presence in her life, and of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">fact that her sister was doing the best she could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Elizabeth also used the mantras in her marriage. In the beginning, whenever</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">her husband said something that really hurt her, she immediately had the desire</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to punish. She tried instead slowly going to him and using her version of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">fourth mantra, asking him, “You said this thing to me that I really don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand. What was that about?” He would share, and most times, she</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">discovered that his remark was nothing about her really. It was often something</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">else entirely that was going on. The mantra “opened up a door” for her “to see</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">what was happening in his world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes, Elizabeth would say something to her husband, and he’d have a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">strong reaction, and she’d react to his reaction. Eventually she learned to instead</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice the third mantra—“I know you suffer; that’s why I’m here for you”—by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">asking him, “Was it something I said? I really want to understand what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happened. I’m sorry. I don’t mean to say or do things that are hurtful. If you let</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">me know, I can understand how the things I say affect you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">She also told me about one particular time during her stay in Plum Village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">She was in the courtyard garden, harvesting the petals of rose blossoms that were</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">just beginning to droop, to use for tea. A gardener came along and scolded</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Elizabeth for taking away flowers that were growing there for everyone to enjoy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in the courtyard. Elizabeth said, “I’m not taking the fresh ones, only the fading</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ones.” But the gardener was not appeased. Elizabeth went to ask the advice of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">one of our nuns who she knew could help her understand. The sister shared with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">her that lately some other people had been picking flowers from the garden for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">their own use, and the gardener had a sensitivity about that. “Elizabeth,” the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sister said, “you just bumped into his sensitivity.” After she heard that, Elizabeth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">was able to go to the gardener and practice the third mantra. She said, “I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand the situation better now, and I won’t touch the flowers in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">courtyard if you prefer.” The gardener was getting ready to go away on a trip to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Germany, and Elizabeth also practiced the first mantra—“I’m here for you”—by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">telling him that during his absence, she would water the roses and trim the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">rosehips for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Another friend recently shared that he was suffering a lot during a retreat. He</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">chose to practice the fourth mantra—“I suffer; please help”—by sharing with his</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">roommates that he didn’t need to talk about anything, just to be allowed space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This allowed his roommates to understand what was happening with him, not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">take it personally, and be more accepting when he wasn’t able to be there for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">them as they would like. It was beneficial to see what he needed and for him to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ask for that support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The Six Mantras are something that everyone can practice at home. Children</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can do them too. So often children feel powerless in the family. But with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness, concentration, and practice of the Six Mantras, they have a tool. By</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">saying a mantra with love and full presence, a child can change the situation—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even a tense one—right away. It also gives parents a chance to use the language</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of love instead of authority when communicating with their children. This keeps</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication alive between parents and children. When there’s no real</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication in the family, both parents and children suffer. The practice of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the Six Mantras is a way to use loving speech and deep listening to keep the door</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of communication open. With this kind of communication, we will understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">each other better, and then our love will be true love because it will be based on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Bringing Compassionate Communication to Your Relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you are able to use the Six Mantras with your loved ones, you will find</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that you are building a kind of home together. By listening compassionately to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, you have started to come home to yourself. With compassionate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication, you can help your loved ones come home to themselves. Your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loved ones are also looking for home—for some warmth and a refuge. Once you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have a home, you can help the other person. You are confident because you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know how to connect with yourself and make a home for yourself. Your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">confidence can inspire others to do the same. They may find a home in you, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">then lean on that to build a home in themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You don’t need an iPhone to do this. You need your eyes, to look at them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with compassion. You need your ears and your mouth to listen with compassion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and speak mindfully. When your loved one is able to go back to himself or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">herself, then your relationship becomes a real relationship, because both of you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">feel at home in yourselves. Don’t be afraid to give your loved ones the space</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">they need to listen to themselves. When you have enough space to listen to your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">own self, when you come together, you find a home in each other as well as in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourselves. There is a communal home for you to share. This becomes the base</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of all your relationships. If you want to help society, your community, your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">country, you have to have a home base. When you have a true home in yourself</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and in your home, you have happiness, safety, and fulfillment. Then you are in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">position to go out and help create a more compassionate and loving community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">5</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">When Difficulties Arise</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many of us suffer because our communication with other people is difficult. At</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">work, for example, we often feel we have tried everything and there is no way to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reach our colleagues. This is often true in families as well. We feel our parents,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our siblings, or our children are too stuck in their ways. We think no real</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication is possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Yet there are many ways to reconcile and to create openings for more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassionate communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Communicating When You’re Angry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">One reason we have trouble communicating with others is that we often try to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate when we are angry. We suffer, and we don’t want to be alone with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">all that suffering. We believe that we are angry because of something others did,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and we want them to know it. Anger has urgency to it. We want to let others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know right away what the problem with them is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But when we’re angry, we aren’t lucid. Acting while angry can lead to a lot</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of suffering and can escalate the situation. That doesn’t mean we should</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suppress our anger. We shouldn’t pretend that everything is fine when it isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It’s possible to feel and engage with our anger in a healthy and compassionate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">manner. When anger is there, we should handle it with tenderness because our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger is us. We shouldn’t do violence to our anger. Doing violence to our anger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is doing violence to ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mindful breathing helps us recognize our anger and treat it tenderly. Mindful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">energy embraces the energy of anger. Anger is a strong energy, and we may need</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to sit with it for a while. When you cook potatoes, you have to maintain the fire</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">underneath for at least fifteen or twenty minutes. The same is true of the practice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of mindfulness when it embraces anger. It will take a while, because the anger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">takes a while to cook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">After you have sat with mindful awareness and calmed your anger, you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">look deeply into the anger to see its nature and where it has come from. What is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the root of that anger? Anger may come from a wrong perception or a habitual</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">way of responding to events that doesn’t reflect our deepest values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In popular psychotherapy, we’re sometimes encouraged to express our anger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">physically to “get it out of our system.” We’re advised to allow our anger to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">manifest by shouting in a secluded place or hitting an inanimate substitute, such</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">as a pillow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I haven’t found this practice to be useful in transforming the roots of anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Think of a woodstove. If something goes wrong with it, you can open the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">windows so the smoke goes out. But if the stove still has that defect, the smoke</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will come again. You have to fix the woodstove. Yelling and punching your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">pillow can be just rehearsing and nourishing anger and making it stronger, not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">getting it out of your system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You have to get genuinely in touch with your anger in order to heal. While</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re hitting your pillow, you’re not really getting in touch with your anger in a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">way that helps your understanding grow. You’re not even getting in touch with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the pillow, because if you were in touch with the pillow, you would know that it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">was only a pillow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Suppressing anger can be dangerous. It will explode if it is ignored. Anger,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">like all strong emotions, wants to express itself. So how do we handle it? The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">best thing is to go home to ourselves and take care of our anger. We can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">remember the first mantra and be there for ourselves and take care of our anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We return to ourselves and connect body and mind. Return to your practice of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindful breathing and mindful walking. To be present means to be mindful and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">then use that mindfulness to recognize, embrace, and look deeply at our strong</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Usually when anger manifests, we want to confront the person we think is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the source of our anger. We’re more interested in setting that person straight than</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in taking care of the more urgent matter, which is our own anger. We are like the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person whose house is on fire who goes chasing after the arsonist instead of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">going home to put out the fire. Meanwhile, the house continues to burn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There are many things you can do to communicate that you are suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">over something that somebody has done. You can write a note or send an e-mail</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to the person. But first practice mindful breathing and take care of your anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This is a perfect time to use the fourth mantra: “I suffer. Please help.” You may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">phone the other person once you have calmed your anger, but only when you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">calmly tell him or her that you suffer and you want help. You can let the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person know that you are doing your best to take care of your suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Encourage that person to do the same. Asking for help when we’re angry is very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">difficult, but it allows others to see your suffering instead of just your anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">They will see that suffering causes the anger, and then communication and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">healing can begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Helping Each Other Suffer Less</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we have a rift or an estrangement from someone we care about, both</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">people suffer. If we didn’t care deeply about the other person, the rift would not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be so painful. It’s the people we care most about who trigger our greatest</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering. We may spend a long time living with the rift, until we start to think of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it as irreparable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But as long as it’s there, we’ll always be trying to avoid it, to cover it up,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">because we are afraid to be in touch with the suffering inside. We can pretend</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that it’s not there, but it’s really there, a big block inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The suffering in us demands to be understood. With our daily practice, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can generate enough mindfulness and be strong enough to come home to our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering without fear. Mindfulness helps us recognize suffering inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mindfulness helps us embrace that suffering, which is the first step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When someone has caused you a lot of pain, you may not even want to look</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">at or be in the same room as that person, because you will suffer. With</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">awareness, you can understand your own suffering and recognize the suffering in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the other person. You may even understand that the reason that person suffers so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">much is because he or she doesn’t know how to handle the suffering. His</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering spills out, and you are its victim. Maybe he doesn’t want to make you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffer, but he doesn’t know another way. He can’t understand and transform his</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering, and so he makes the people around him suffer too, even when that’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not his intention. Because he suffers, you suffer. He doesn’t need punishment; he</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">needs help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You can help by acknowledging the suffering in him. If there is some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">difficulty in a relationship, we have to acknowledge the difficulty. It’s tempting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to say that everything is okay, because the difficulty can feel overwhelming. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">without acknowledging the difficulty, we can’t generate understanding and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion, and we feel alienated. We can’t help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You have to use the tools of compassionate communication, the deep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening and loving speech you have practiced, to restore communication with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the person with whom you are having difficulty. After a short period of mindful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breathing, you can say something like this to the other person:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“I know you’re not feeling too happy right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“In the past I didn’t understand your feelings, so I reacted in a way that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">made you suffer more, and that also made me suffer more. I wasn’t able</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to help you resolve the problem. I reacted angrily in a way that has made</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the situation worse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“It’s not my intention to make you suffer. It’s because I didn’t understand</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your suffering, and I didn’t understand my suffering either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“I understand my difficult feelings better now, and I also want to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand yours. Understanding your suffering, your difficulties, will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">help me behave in a way that can be more helpful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“If you care for me, help me understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“Tell me what is in your heart. I want to listen; I want to understand. Tell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">me about your suffering and your difficulties. If you don’t help me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand, who will?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">These are just examples. It’s important that the words be your own. When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you have the energy of compassion in your heart, your own loving words will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">come to you naturally. When you are very angry at someone, in the heat of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">moment, it’s almost impossible to use loving speech. But when understanding</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">arises, compassion comes, and it’s possible to use loving speech without having</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to make a lot of effort. A doctor who doesn’t see the nature of the sickness can’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">help the patient. A psychotherapist who doesn’t understand a patient’s suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can’t help. Loving speech can open the door. Then you have an opportunity to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice deep listening and help the other person heal the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It takes courage to acknowledge difficulty in a relationship. You may think</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you will just wait until the other person comes to you first, but that may not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happen. You can’t wait. You can begin the practice of restoring communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">by modeling open-hearted, compassionate dialogue. You may have to give</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself a deadline for making a start. When people come to weeklong retreats, I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">give them a deadline of the last night of the retreat to begin the reconciliation. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you are truly practicing, others will see that and be affected by it. They may not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be able to show it right away, but what you say and the look in your eyes will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have an effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Suffering of Pride</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There is a well-known Vietnamese story about a young couple who suffered</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deeply because they didn’t practice mindful communication. The husband went</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">off to war and left his pregnant wife behind. Three years later, when he was</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">released from the army, his wife came to the village gate to welcome him and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">brought along their little boy. It was the first time the man had seen his child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When the young couple saw each other, they could not hold back the tears of joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">They were so grateful that the young man had survived and come home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In Vietnam, there is a tradition that when an important event happens we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">make an offering on an altar to our ancestors and tell them what has happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The wife went to the market to buy flowers, fruits, and other provisions for an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">offering to place on the altar. The father stayed home with his son and tried to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">persuade the little boy to call him “Daddy.” But the little boy refused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">He said, “Mister, you aren’t my daddy. My daddy is someone else. He used</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to come and visit us every night. Whenever he came, my mother would talk to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">him for a long time and cry and cry. When my mother sat down, the man sat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">down. When my mother lay down, he also lay down. So you are not my daddy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Hearing these words, the young father’s heart turned to stone. He could no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">longer smile. He became silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When his wife returned, the man didn’t look at her or speak to her anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">He was very cold; he acted as though he despised her. She didn’t understand why</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and she began to suffer deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">After the ceremony to make an offering to the ancestors, it’s traditional to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">take the offering from the altar, and then the family sits down and enjoys the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">meal with happiness. But after the young man performed the offering, he didn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">do this. He left the house, went into the village, and spent his time in the liquor</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">shop. He got drunk because he couldn’t bear his suffering. When the husband</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">came home it was very late. He did the same thing every evening. He never</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">talked to his wife, never looked at her, never ate at home. The young lady</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffered so much she couldn’t bear it, and on the fourth day she jumped into the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">river and drowned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The evening after the funeral, the young father and the boy came home. As</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the man lit the kerosene lamp, the little boy shouted: “Here is my father!” and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">pointed to the shadow of his father on the wall. It turned out that the young</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">woman used to talk to her shadow every night, because she missed her husband</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">so much. One day the little boy had said, “Everyone in the village has a father,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">why don’t I have one?” In order to calm the little boy, she pointed to her shadow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that night on the wall, and said, “There is your father!” Of course when she sat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">down, the shadow would sit down too. Now the young father understood. His</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">wrong perception had been wiped away. But it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">What if the young man had gone to his wife and asked: “Darling, I’ve</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffered so much the last few days. I don’t think I can survive. Please help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Please tell me who is that person who used to come every night, and with whom</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you talked and cried.” That’s a very simple thing to do. If he had done this, the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">young lady would have had a chance to explain, the tragedy would have been</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">averted, and they would have recovered their happiness very easily. That’s the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">direct way. But he didn’t do this because he was so deeply hurt and his pride</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">prevented him from going to her and asking for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The woman suffered so much as well. She was deeply hurt because of her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">husband’s behavior, but she didn’t ask for his help. Perhaps, if she’d asked her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">husband what was wrong, he would have told her what their son had said. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">she didn’t because she, too, was caught in pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A wrong perception can be the cause of a lot of suffering. All of us are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">subject to misunderstanding. We live with wrong perceptions every day. That’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">why we have to practice meditation and looking deeply into the nature of our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perceptions. Whatever we perceive, we have to ask ourselves, “Are you sure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your perception is right?” To be safe, you have to ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We’re subject to many wrong perceptions in our daily lives. It may be that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the other person didn’t have the intention to hurt you. Mindful communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">has the potential to ease so much of the unnecessary suffering in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Reconciling in Families</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes communication is hardest in our own family because families share</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">similar suffering and ways of responding to suffering. The suffering of your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">parents was passed down from their parents and from their ancestors before</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">them. Unless you begin to understand your own suffering and reconcile with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, that suffering will continue to be passed down to future generations. So</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we do the work of mindful communication not just for ourselves and our loved</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ones, but for our descendants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Understanding your own suffering, you understand the suffering of your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">father. Your father may have had a lot of suffering and been unable to handle and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">transform the suffering, so he transmitted the whole mass of suffering to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You inherit this suffering from him and from your mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we’re still young, many of us are determined to be different from our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">parents. We say we’ll never make our children suffer. But when we grow up we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tend to behave just like our parents, and we make others suffer because, like our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ancestors, we don’t know how to handle the energies we’ve inherited. We’ve</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">received many positive and negative seeds from our parents and ancestors. They</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">transmitted their habit to us because they didn’t know how to transform it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes these habit energies have passed through many generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You have to recognize that you are the continuation of your father, mother,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and ancestors. Cultivate mindfulness so you can recognize the habit energy each</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time it arises and embrace it with your energy of mindfulness. Each time we’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">able to do this, the habit energy becomes weaker. If we keep practicing like this,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we can stop the cycle of transmission, and this will benefit not only us but our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">children and descendants. We can also help our children learn how to handle</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">their habit energies and nourish the positive elements they have inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The suffering we received from our parents when we were children is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">probably our deepest suffering. We may hate our parents and feel that, whether</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or not they are still living, we will never reconcile with them. Yet with our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice of breathing mindfully, walking mindfully, and looking deeply, we can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bring about transformation and restore communication in even the most difficult</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">families. If the other person also practices mindful awareness, it’s much easier,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">but reconciliation is possible even if the other person doesn’t know about the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Relationships with parents and siblings can be particularly difficult. Maybe</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">during their childhood they were deeply wounded, and no one listened to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">So now they are perpetuating the cycle, and they don’t want to listen to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Don’t ask your family members to change. When you’re able to generate the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">energy of understanding and compassion in yourself, reconciliation can begin to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">take place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I still remember a retreat in Oldenburg, in northern Germany. On the fourth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">day of the retreat, I gave everyone a midnight deadline to begin reconciling with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">someone with whom they had great difficulty. The next morning, one man came</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to me and said, “I’ve been so angry at my father for years. I couldn’t even look</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">at him. Even when I dialed his number last night, I doubted I could talk to him</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">calmly.” But when he heard his father’s voice, he found that he naturally used</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">loving speech; he didn’t even have to try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">He said, “I know you’ve suffered a lot during the past many years. I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I know I’ve acted and spoken in a way that didn’t help. I didn’t mean to make</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you suffer.” His father heard the compassion in his son’s voice and told him for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the first time about his suffering and his difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Reconciliation is possible. You can find resolution to the difficulties in your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relationships. You don’t need to allow the difficulties to continue causing you to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffer month after month and year after year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The first step is to practice mindful breathing, mindful walking, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness in daily activities, so that you will be strong enough to go back to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, listen to your own suffering, and look deeply into its nature. Unless we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listen to our own suffering, there’s no chance of improving the quality of our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relationships. With mindfulness, compassion arises, and you can accept yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Then you have the chance to look at others. Even if they are not there with you,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you can sit still and close your eyes and see the suffering they have gone through</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">for so many years. When you can see the suffering in others, you begin to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand that there is a reason they suffer like that. You are no longer angry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with them anymore. Compassion will arise in your heart. When compassion is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">born, you are more peaceful, your mind is clearer, and you will be motivated to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">say or do something to help others transform their difficulties. Reconciliation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">becomes possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Communicating in Long-Term Relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In long-term relationships, as in families, we often get in the habit of thinking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that change isn’t possible. We think the other person should change and they</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">won’t, so we give up hope. But we need to stop judging and return to our own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">internal communication. If we wait for our parents or our partner to change, it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may take a very long time. If we wait for the other person to change, we may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">spend all our time waiting. So it’s better that you change yourself. Don’t try to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">force the other person to change. Even if it takes a long time, you will feel better</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">when you are master of yourself and you are doing your best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes when you see your partner behaving in a way that irritates you,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you might want to reproach him or her. If you immediately try to correct him, he</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may get irritated, and then you both are irritated and become unkind. It is as if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the blue sky disappears, the green trees disappear, and you are two blocks of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering bumping against each other. This is the escalation of war, the escalation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of unhappiness. You have to disentangle yourself from the unhappiness and go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">back to yourself, back to your peace, until you know how to handle the situation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in a loving way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Then, only when you are calm, invite your partner to speak. You can say you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">are sorry for not having understood her or him better. Only say this when you are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ready. Then listen to her deeply, even if what she says is complaining,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reproachful, or not very kind. You may learn that your partner has many wrong</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perceptions about you and about the situation, but try not to interrupt. Let her</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speak. Let her have a chance to speak out everything in her so she can feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listened to and understood. As your partner speaks, continue to breathe</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfully. Later on you may find a way to undo her misunderstanding, little by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">little in a very skillful, loving way, and mutual understanding will grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If your partner says something untrue, don’t interrupt and say, “No, no,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re wrong. That wasn’t my intention.” Let him speak out. He’s just trying to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speak out the difficulty. If you interrupt, he will lose his inspiration to speak, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">he will not tell you everything. You have plenty of time. You may even take a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">number of days to look deeply, in order to skillfully tell him about his wrong</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perception when he can hear it. You may have been angry with each other for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">years, and maybe because of just one condition, you’re stuck and can’t change</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the situation. If you can understand him deeply, you can start to make peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Loving, compassionate speech and deep listening are the most powerful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">instruments for restoring communication. If you can understand and transform</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself, then you can help your partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Sometimes we’re in a negative environment that doesn’t leave us space to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate with ourselves. Sometimes we may need to change the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">environment around us. But sometimes, in a relationship, we think separation or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">divorce is the only alternative. This is true if we’re in a violent or abusive</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">situation. It’s important that we be in a place where we feel safe and not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">vulnerable. But if you are in a relationship where both people love each other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and don’t intentionally hurt each other, but you just don’t know how to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate, there may be other solutions. Many people think divorce is the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">solution, but after the papers are signed, they continue to suffer. If there are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">children or financial or other matters connecting you, you will still have to deal</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with each other for years to come. You can’t take the other person out of you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You can’t take yourself out of others. The suffering still continues. So the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">question is not whether you will stay together or not; the question is whether you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can focus on trying to understand each other using compassionate speech and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deep listening, no matter what the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Mutual Understanding in Challenging Situations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Compassionate communication is an extraordinarily powerful way to create</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mutual understanding and make changes. It can be used in situations where</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">many people thought connection and communication impossible. It can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">transform situations where both parties are full of both fear and anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I have seen this when we’ve hosted groups of Israelis and Palestinians at</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Plum Village. The first few days of such a retreat are always very difficult. In the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">beginning, both groups are full of fear, anger, and mistrust. The two groups don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even like to look at each other, they’re so suspicious. They don’t feel good when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">they look at each other because they’ve suffered a lot, and they believe that their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering has been brought by the other side. During that first week, we focus</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">solely on communicating with ourselves. Both groups practice and train in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindful breathing, nonthinking, and deep listening to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Only in the second week do we encourage the compassionate communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practices of deep listening and loving speech with each other. The group that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speaks is encouraged to use the kind of language that could help the others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand the suffering they’ve gone through, the children as well as the adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Each group tells the other about every kind of suffering they have undergone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But they do it using loving speech and trying not to blame or accuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We advise the listening group to listen with compassion. If they hear a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">misperception, they shouldn’t try to interrupt and correct, because they will have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">plenty of time later on to help the other group correct their perceptions. When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">one group listens deeply to the other group, they recognize, maybe for the first</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time, that the other side has suffered very much, and that the suffering of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other group is very much like their own suffering, even if the circumstances are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">different. For many it’s the first time that they recognize people on the other side</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">as human beings just like them, who have suffered just like them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you understand their suffering, you feel compassion for them, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suddenly you don’t hate anymore, you’re not afraid of them anymore. Your way</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of looking at them has changed. They see compassion and acceptance in your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">eyes, and right away they suffer less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">These sessions of deep listening are organized in such a way that people have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enough time to listen and talk about their suffering. Some of us who were</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">present at these sessions were neither Palestinian nor Israeli. We were monks,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">nuns, and lay practitioners who came to sit and breathe with them and support</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">their practice. We practiced mindful breathing and offered the collective energy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of peace and mindfulness so they could practice listening with compassion. Our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">presence with the two groups was very important. We created a collective energy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that supported mindful speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I think we can organize the same practice for ourselves or for any two groups</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">who are divided. Sometimes Hindus are afraid of Muslims, and at the same time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Muslims are afraid of Hindus. In other situations, Muslims are afraid of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Christians and Christians are afraid of Muslims. We think of the other group as a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">threat to our survival and to our identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The first thing is to look deeply and see that not only on your side but also on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the other side there’s a lot of fear and suffering. In the beginning we think that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we are the only ones who suffer and have a lot of fear. But if we get close</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enough to the other side and look, we see that they also have a lot of fear—fear</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of us—and also suffering. When we can see their suffering and fear, we suffer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">less already. When we’re able to produce a compassionate thought, this thought</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">begins to heal us, heal the other, and heal the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Peace Negotiations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I think if government officials organized peace talks the way we organize</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sessions of deep listening and loving speech, they would have more success in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">bringing reconciliation to opposing parties. When opposing parties come</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">together to negotiate, they shouldn’t negotiate right away. Each group has a lot</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of doubt, anger, and fear in them, and negotiating may be too challenging when</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">these strong emotions are present. The first part of any peace initiative should be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">devoted to the practice of breathing, walking, sitting, and calming. Then the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">groups may be ready to listen to each other, and the desire and capacity for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mutual understanding will be there to serve as a basis for successful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If the atmosphere gets too heated during the negotiating session and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tension too strong, the chairperson should invite everyone to stop and breathe in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and out to calm themselves down. Even if someone was in the middle of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">addressing the group, everyone should stop and breathe in and out together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When I addressed a meeting of congressional representatives in Washington,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">D.C., I proposed a similar process. After that, we offered a retreat for a number</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of representatives, and we practiced mindfulness together. That was many years</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ago, but there are a few members of Congress who still practice mindful walking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">on Capitol Hill. It’s possible and very beneficial to bring compassionate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication and mindful speech into political life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There’s no place where deep listening and loving speech are inappropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We don’t need to save these techniques for a special occasion. They can be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">adapted to any situation and be helpful. If we use them now, we will have the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding and insight we need to repair the damage we caused in the past</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and bring healing to ourselves, our families, our relationships, and our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">6</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">Mindful Communication at Work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Successful work communication begins before we even arrive at our jobs. Often</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">on our way to work—as we drive, bike, take the train, ride the bus, or walk—we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">focus on what we’ll have to do when we arrive or on something we didn’t finish</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">before we left home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If we instead bring our awareness to mindful breathing and to what’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">happening right in that moment, we can enjoy every moment of transporting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ourselves to work. Before I begin my work of teaching for the day, I don’t spend</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time worrying about what questions people might ask or how I might answer</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">them. Instead, as I walk from my room to the place where I teach, I enjoy every</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">step and every breath fully, and I live each moment of my walk deeply. This</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">way, when I arrive, I feel fresh and ready to work. I can offer my best answer to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">any question I may be asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you arrive at your workplace having already practiced mindfulness while</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">getting ready at home and while on your way, you’ll arrive happier and more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relaxed than you have in the past, and successful communication will come a lot</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">more easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The way you think about your work and your work relationships affects how</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you communicate in your work environment. You may be under the impression</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that the purpose of your work is to offer a service to others or to produce an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">object or commodity. But while at work, you’re also producing thoughts, speech,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and actions. Communication is as much a part of your job as is the end product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you communicate well in your work environment, not only do you enjoy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself more, but you create a harmonious atmosphere that will carry over into</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your work. Everything you do will have a stronger element of compassion and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be of greater benefit to more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Leading by Example</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When I was in India a number of years ago, I met Mr. K. R. Narayanan when he</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">was the president of the Indian Parliament. We spoke about using the practice of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deep listening and compassionate dialogue in legislative bodies. I said that any</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">work environment, including a legislative assembly, could become a community</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">motivated by mutual understanding and compassion. If we create a healthy and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">nourishing work community, we are modeling the kind of environment we want</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to create in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When, in a work environment, you use mindful and compassionate speech,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re offering the best of yourself. If we can combine our insights and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">experiences the collective insight will bring about the wisest decisions. If we’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not able to listen to our colleagues with a free heart, if we only consider and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">support ideas that we already know and agree with, we’re harming our work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">environment. Whatever your position is at work, you can set an example by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">learning to listen to everyone with equal interest and concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many workplaces are characterized by daily stress. We need to set up spaces</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">at work for the practice of mindful breathing. Mindful breathing is the first step</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to mindful communicating because it relaxes us in body and mind. We have to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be relaxed, to feel well, so that we can make the best decisions possible. When</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we model relaxation at work, we are already communicating powerfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Mr. Narayanan and I talked about integrating mindful breathing into the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Parliament of India as a way to reduce stress. If they can do it in the legislature,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perhaps you can do it in your workplace. Can you bring your colleagues together</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to practice mindful breathing or make time available for this before any group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">meeting so that people will be able to communicate more effectively and without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">stress? If you can’t organize others, even your own mindful breathing will make</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your work communication go better. Sometimes workplace communication can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">seem so difficult, but one mindful breath already begins to make it easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Greeting Your Colleagues</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">What is the first thing you do when you arrive at work? Do you smile at the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">people you see? Do you greet them? The first few minutes are crucial in setting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the tone for your workday. You may feel you have too much on your mind. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may still be absorbed in an argument or in something challenging that happened</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">before you arrived. But if you’ve spent the time getting to work breathing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfully and being in the present moment, you will arrive with a clear mind</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and you’ll be able to greet people with a warm and open smile. This is part of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your job, no matter what your profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Answering the Phone</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">At work, many of us communicate not just with the people around us but by e-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mail, telephone, or video conferencing. Some of us work primarily with people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">who aren’t in the same physical space or even in the same time zone or country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Even so, you can turn every phone conversation or e-mail into an opportunity to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice compassionate communication. Whenever the phone rings, you can hear</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it as a bell of mindfulness and stop whatever you’re doing. Instead of rushing to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">answer the phone, you can breathe in and out with awareness three times before</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">answering to make sure you’re truly present for whoever is calling. Recognize</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">any feelings of stress or irritation you may have or any feeling that you’re being</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">interrupted. You may want to put your hand on the receiver while breathing to let</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your coworkers know that you intend to pick up the phone, but you’re just not in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a hurry. This will help remind them that they don’t need to feel like they’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">victims of the telephone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You can use the same practice before reading an e-mail. At work we often go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">from one e-mail to the next without first practicing mindful breathing and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">making ourselves present for whatever that e-mail has to say. If we wait until</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we’ve taken a few mindful breaths and returned to being fully present before we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">open an e-mail, it’s true that it will take us a little longer to go through our mail,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and our work might be a bit slower. But our communication with each e-mail</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will be more effective, clearer, and more understanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you want to send an e-mail or call someone on the phone, you might want</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to recite the following verse to yourself before you begin to type or to dial the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">number:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Words can travel thousands of miles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">May my words create mutual understanding and love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">May they be as beautiful as gems,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">as lovely as flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Mindful Meetings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Our communication in meetings can often be a source of tension, stress, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">conflict at work. Sometimes we rush from one meeting to another, so we arrive</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">already anxious or distracted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It will help to schedule a few minutes at the beginning of any meeting to sit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">quietly together. If people in your workplace are open to having a bell sound</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">before the meeting begins, that sound can help everyone come back to their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breathing and find some calm. If people don’t want to start the meeting by sitting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">together quietly for a few moments, you can still arrive at the meeting a few</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">minutes early so you have time to relax and breathe mindfully. Perhaps other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">people will see your example and join you the next time. You don’t need to say</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anything or make a point of letting others know you’re doing this. Just do it and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enjoy the benefit it brings you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It can be helpful in setting the tone of a meeting to open with a spoken</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">agreement that the participants will respect each other’s words and be open to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the views of others. If we try to impose our views on others, we only create</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tension and suffering at work. So in any meeting, practice being open and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening to the experience and insight of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you have a wonderful idea and are eager to share it, that’s good, but you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">shouldn’t be so eager to share your ideas that you drown out the ideas of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Invite everybody to express their ideas. Trust that the best ideas will emerge</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">from this process as collective wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">During the meeting, practice using loving speech and deep listening. Follow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your breathing as you listen. Let one person speak at a time, without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">interruption. Don’t get caught up in verbal duels. Speak from your own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">experience, and address the whole group whenever you talk. If you have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">questions or concerns, place them in the center of the circle for the whole group</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to contemplate and address. This may be challenging; it is likely a new culture</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">for conducting meetings, one that is different from the way meetings have been</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">run in the past. You don’t have to try to change the culture all at once. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">everyone agrees to listen mindfully and without interruption, that is wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But even if it’s only you who follows these guidelines and makes a commitment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to speak and listen with compassion, it will have a positive effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Creating Community at Work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you’re modeling compassionate communication at work, soon others may be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">interested in practicing mindful breathing, sitting, and walking with you. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re surrounded by people who are practicing mindfulness together, you’ll all</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be supported by the collective energy, and mindful speech and deep listening</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will come much more easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The more you practice mindfulness, the more you’ll see things you can do to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">change your work environment in a positive way. When we practice mindful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech and deep listening, our way of communicating becomes a bell of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness for everyone. When you walk mindfully, enjoying every step you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">take, this encourages others to do the same, even if they don’t know that you’re</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practicing mindfulness. When you smile, your smile supports everyone around</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you and also reminds others to smile. When you practice, your presence has a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">positive effect on you and those around you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">A Rock in the River</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">All of us have difficulties at work sometimes. We all have our own pain,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sorrows, and fears. Often at work we don’t give ourselves time or space to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">recognize and embrace these strong emotions, so our tension comes out in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">unintentional ways. This can make communication difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">But none of us needs to embrace pain and sorrow alone. When you throw a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">rock into a river, no matter how small the rock is, it will sink to the bottom of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">river. But if you have a boat, you can carry many tons of rocks, and they won’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sink. The same is true of our suffering. Our sorrow, fear, worries, and pain are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">like rocks that can be carried by the boat of mindfulness. If we give ourselves the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time and space to embrace and recognize the suffering, we won’t sink into the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ocean of anger, worries, or sorrow. We become lighter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can practice mindfulness alone, but we can find more ease and joy if we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can bring mindful communication into our work environments and have the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">support of others who are practicing mindfulness with us. Don’t expect to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">change your work environment overnight. But if you make a diligent effort to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice compassionate communication, both with yourself and with your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">colleagues, you’re taking steps in the right direction, and that is good enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">Creating Community in the World</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">As powerful as compassionate communication can be when we use it in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">individual relationships, its power is magnified when we bring it to our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communities. Both </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">communication</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> and </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">community</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> have the same Latin root,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">communicare</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">, meaning to impart, share, or make common. We need to go in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">direction of reconciliation and understanding, not just with our friends and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">family, but in our neighborhoods and workplaces. We can create an inclusive,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassionate foundation as the basis from which we interact with everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A community that is committed to mindful speech and deep listening can be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">very effective in making society better. These two practices could be part of a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">global ethic that would be available to people of any culture or religious tradition</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to reduce conflict and restore communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Community Creates Change</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can speak of our practice in terms of energy because mindfulness is a kind of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">energy. When we bring our energies together, they are increased a thousandfold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The whole can be much, much greater than the sum of its parts. Systematic</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">change can’t be achieved without the energy of community. If you want to save</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the planet, if you want to transform society, you need a strong community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Technology is not enough. Without mindfulness, technology can be more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">destructive than constructive. When we speak about creating a sustainable</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">environment or a more just society, we usually speak of physical action or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">technological advances as the means to achieve these goals. But we forget about</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the element of a connected community. Without that, we can’t do anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Usually we think of communal action in terms of physical acts, but the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">energy of a shared meditative silence or communal chanting is also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication and a powerful kind of action. I don’t think of this concentration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">so much as prayer or a religious rite, but rather as a form of communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we sit and concentrate as a community, we create a collective energy that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">has compassion and awakened understanding in it. Sitting together in silence can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">be a practice of listening to our own suffering and the suffering of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The collective energy of mindfulness also supports our individual practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we see other people who are in good communication with themselves and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">others, they inspire us. Sometimes the cause of our sorrow is hidden by so many</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">layers of suffering that we can’t penetrate it by ourselves, even when we practice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">diligently and sit mindfully. In these cases, the energy of a community of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness can help us embrace and release suffering that we could not reach</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">by ourselves. If we open our hearts, the collective energy of the community can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">penetrate the suffering inside us. Mindful listening and speaking will make it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">easier for us to build a stronger community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Building Trust and Sharing Suffering</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Some of us do not easily trust another person. For such a person, it can be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">difficult to imagine sharing with a larger community. We may be a little bit wary</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or even very suspicious. People say they love us and understand us, but we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">haven’t really experienced that love and understanding. We should be able to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">find ways to help a person who doesn’t have the capacity to receive love and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding. Sometimes there is real love, there is real understanding, but the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person doesn’t believe in love and understanding, and that’s why he has never</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">been able to receive it. That person is like a hungry ghost. In Buddhism, a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“hungry ghost” is someone who has a big, empty stomach and is very hungry but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">has a very tiny throat. Even if there’s plenty of food, that person can’t swallow it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">He can’t absorb anything. So even if a lot of understanding and love is offered,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that person isn’t able to take it in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A person who suffers like that has no capacity to receive understanding, love,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and help. You have to be very patient. From time to time we see hungry ghosts</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">like that walking around, and we can recognize them easily. They look very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">alone and cut off. We have to be very patient and allow them a lot of time and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">space. Don’t be too eager to help, because when you’re too eager to help, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may have the opposite effect from what you intended, and you may get an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">opposite response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Remain fresh, loving, compassionate, and spacious for them. That is what</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you can do now. Look deeply to see if you can find a mantra to say that’s skillful</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enough to help them enlarge their throats and get nourishment. With patience</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and time, one day their throats will be larger, and they will begin to notice the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">energy of love and understanding that is in you. Community building takes time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Community Strengthens Compassion</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Scientists have studied the behavior of social animals, such as birds and fish, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">have found that in every community there is an element of altruism; some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">members of the community are ready to die and sacrifice their lives for the sake</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">There is a kind of fish called a stickleback. They swim in bands, thousands</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of them. Whenever they notice the shadow of a predator, a large fish that might</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">threaten the band of fish, a few dozen will detach themselves and go explore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">They know there’s a risk, but they want to go in that direction to see if the threat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is real. If they find there’s no risk, they go back and rejoin the band of fish. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">there is a real danger, a few of them will stay to be swallowed by the big fish</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">while the rest go back and tell the band of fish to go in another direction. Ants</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">also behave like that, as do bees and some kinds of birds. We humans also hear</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">news reports of heroes sacrificing themselves in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This behavior on the part of some members of your community nourishes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your own generosity and altruism. Scientists in this fish study found that if a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">school stays together, the generosity will grow. The descendants will profit and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">become more and more generous. But if they are dispersed, the generosity dies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">down very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">According to scientists who have conducted studies, when you’re exposed to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">such behavior from some members of your community, the seed of altruism in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you is watered. And when your turn comes, you will do the same—you will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know how to sacrifice for the sake of the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Living in the world, we have strong habits. We walk without any awareness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">or enjoyment of our steps. We walk as if we have to run. We speak but don’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know what we are saying; we create a lot of suffering while speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Communities that commit themselves to mindfulness can help members of the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">community learn how to speak, breathe, and walk mindfully. The community</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">helps train you, and you train yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When we practice in a community, there are more people to support us but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">also more opportunities for frustration and anger. Loving speech and deep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening are key to community building. You learn to speak in a way that will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not cause suffering in yourself and your community. If your community doesn’t</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice this, it’s not an authentic community. Even if you have suffering and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger, you can train yourself to speak in a way that helps the other person or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">group understand what is going on in you, and that makes real communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Our World Can Be a Mindful, Compassionate Community</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We need to find better ways to communicate. If we can do this in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relationships, we can do it in our work environments, and even in our political</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">environments. We have to transform our governments into mindful,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassionate places of deep listening and loving speech. We each can do our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">part to contribute as a citizen, as a member of the human family. In the process</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of community building we get the transformation and healing we need to further</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the transformation and healing of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This is a process of training and learning. When you speak, allow the insight</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of our collective humanity to speak through you. When you walk, don’t walk for</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yourself alone; walk for your ancestors and your community. When you breathe,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">allow the larger world to breathe for you. When you’re angry, allow your anger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to be released and to be embraced by the larger community. If you know how to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">do this for one day, you are already transformed. Be your community and let</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your community be you. This is true practice. Be like the river when it arrives at</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the ocean; be like the bees and birds that fly together. See yourself in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">community and see the community in you. This is a process of transforming</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your way of seeing, and it will transform how, and how effectively, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communicate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">8</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">Our Communication Is Our Continuation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Every human and every animal communicates. We typically think of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication as the words we use when we speak or write, but our body</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">language, our facial expressions, our tone of voice, our physical actions, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even our thoughts are ways of communicating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Just as an orange tree can produce beautiful orange leaves, blossoms, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">fruits, a beautiful human being can produce beautiful thoughts, speech, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">actions. Our communication is not neutral. Every time we communicate, we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">either produce more compassion, love, and harmony or we produce more</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering and violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Our communication is what we put out into the world and what remains after</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we have left it. In this way, our communication is our karma. The Sanskrit word</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">karma</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> means “action,” and it refers not just to bodily action but to what we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">express with our bodies, our words, and our thoughts and intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Throughout our day, we produce energies of thought, speech, and action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We’re communicating in every moment, either with ourselves or with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Thinking, speech, and bodily acts are our own manifestations. You </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">are</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">action. You are what you do, not only what you do with your body, but also with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your words and your mind. Karma is the triple action of our thoughts, our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech, and our bodily actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Thinking is already action. Even if you don’t see its manifestation, it is there</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">as powerful energy. Thinking can push you to do or say things that are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">destructive, or it can create a lot of love. Every thought will bring a fruit,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sometimes right away, sometimes later on. When you produce a thought of hate,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger, or despair, that thought is a poison which will affect your body and your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mind. A thought of hatred or anger can lead one person to hurt another. If you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">commit a violent act, it means you’ve been producing thoughts of hatred, anger,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and the desire to punish. So thinking is already acting. You don’t need to say or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">do anything in order to be acting. To produce a thought is to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you produce a thought that is full of understanding, forgiveness, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">compassion, that thought will immediately have a healing effect on both your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">physical and mental health and on those around you. If you think a thought that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is full of judgment and anger, that thought will immediately poison your body</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and mind and the people around you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Thinking is the first kind of action, because our thinking is the basis for how</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we affect the world. Our speaking also has a huge effect. If we’re capable of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speaking and writing with compassion and understanding, we feel wonderful in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our bodies and in our minds. We don’t speak with compassion just so that the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person or people we’re speaking to will feel better! Our compassionate speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">has a healing effect on us too. After you have been able to say something kind,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">forgiving, and compassionate, you feel much better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you write words full of compassion and forgiveness, you feel freer,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even if the person you’re writing to hasn’t read them yet. Even before you mail</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the letter or send the e-mail or text, you feel better. The person reading your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">words will also feel your compassion. In the same way, if you speak with anger</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and violence, if you speak out of a desire to punish, both you and the people who</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hear your words experience more suffering. Think of a child hearing her parents</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">fighting. Even if the words are not directed at her, the effect of the angry speech</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is much the same. Speech, the second form of action, can heal and liberate, or it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can cause destruction and pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The third form of action is bodily action. We communicate with our body</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">language (our clenched fists or open arms), but also with our larger actions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">(including what we choose to show up for, what we do with our day, and how we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">treat others). If you are able to do something in the line of saving, supporting,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">protecting, comforting, rescuing, or caring, there is a positive effect right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Every Communication Bears Our Signature</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Everything we say and do bears our signature. We can’t say, “That’s not my</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thought.” We’re responsible for our own communication. So if it happens that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">yesterday I said something that wasn’t right, I have to do something today to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">transform it. The French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre said, “Man is the sum of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">all his actions.” The value of our lives depends on the quality of our thinking,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our speech, and our action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We want to offer the best kind of thinking, the best kind of speech, and the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">best kind of bodily acts, because those actions are our continuation. When we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">think, when we speak, when we act, we create, and we are there in our creations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">That is the outcome of our being. Our communications will not be lost when our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">physical bodies are no longer here. The effect of our thinking, speech, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">physical actions will continue to ripple outward into the cosmos. Whether this</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">body is still here or has disintegrated, our actions continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you produce a thought, it bears your signature. It’s </span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">you</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;"> who produced</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that thought, and you are responsible for it. If it’s a thought of compassion,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">forgiveness, nondiscrimination, you will continue beautifully, because you are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">there in it. You are the author of that action. Your speech and your physical</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">actions, both compassionate and violent, also bear your signature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We are like the cloud that produces the rain. Through the rain, the cloud</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">continues to affect the crops, the trees, and the rivers, even after the cloud is no</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">longer floating there in the sky. Likewise, everything we produce in terms of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thought, speech, and action continues even after our bodies disintegrate. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cloud is there in the cornfield and in the river. When this body disintegrates, our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">words, thoughts, and physical actions continue to have an effect. Our thoughts,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech, and actions are our real continuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">According to this practice, it’s possible to continue beautifully into the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">future. Imagine a bank account somewhere in which we deposit every word,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thought, and physical action. The bank account certainly does exist, but its</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">nature is nonlocal. Nothing is lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Changing the Past</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Suppose in the past you said something unkind to your grandmother. Now she is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">no longer alive, so you can’t apologize directly to her. Many of us carry the guilt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of something we have said or done that we think we can’t rectify. But it’s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">possible to erase that unskillfulness of the past. The past isn’t exactly gone. If we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">know our communication continues, then we know the past is still there,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">disguised in the present moment. After all, the suffering is still there; you can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">touch it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">What you can do is to sit down, breathe in and out deeply, and recognize that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in every cell of your body there is the presence of your grandmother. “Grandma,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I know that you are there in every cell of my body; I am your continuation. I’m</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sorry I said something that made you suffer and made me suffer. Please listen,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Grandma. I promise that from now on, I won’t say such a thing to anyone</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anymore. Grandma, please accept helping me in this practice.” When you talk to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">your grandmother like that, you can see her smiling to you, and you heal the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering of the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Communication isn’t static. Even if yesterday you produced a thought of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger and hate, today you can produce a thought in the opposite direction, a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thought of compassion and tolerance. As soon as we produce the new thought, it</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can very quickly catch up with yesterday’s thought and neutralize it. Using right</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communication today can help us heal the past, enjoy the present, and prepare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the ground for a good future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:20.15999984741211px; color:#0000ee; font-weight:bold;">Practices for Compassionate Communication</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Computer Bell</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Many times when we work with our computers, we are completely lost in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">work, and we forget to be in touch with ourselves. Or we may forget to pay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">attention to our conversations, getting carried away in juicy gossip, criticizing,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">complaining, or other unmindful speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can program a bell of mindfulness on our computers, and every quarter</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of an hour (or as often as we like), the bell sounds and we have a chance to stop</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and go back to ourselves. Breathing in and out three times is enough to release</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the tension in the body and smile, and then we can continue our work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Drinking Tea in Mindfulness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Drinking tea is a wonderful way to set aside time to communicate with yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When I drink my tea, I just drink my tea. I don’t have to think. I can stop all my</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">thinking while I drink my tea. When I stop my thinking, I can focus my attention</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">on the tea. There is only the tea. There is only me. Between me and the tea there</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is a connection. I don’t need a telephone to talk to the tea. In fact, because I’m</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">not on the telephone, I can get more in touch with the tea. I just breathe in, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I’m aware that my in-breath is there, I’m aware that my body is there, and I’m</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">aware that the tea is there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">It’s wonderful to make the time to just drink your tea. In Zen Buddhism we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">don’t normally use commandments as hard and fast rules, but “Drink your tea!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is like a Zen commandment to bring you back to your true home. Don’t think. Be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">there, body and mind united. Establish yourself in the here and the now. You are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">true. You are not a phantom; you are real, and you know what is going on. What</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is going on is that there is a cup of tea in your hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Listening to Your Inner Child</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Every one of us has a wounded child within who needs our care and love. But</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we run away from our inner child because we’re afraid of the suffering. In</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">addition to listening to others with compassion, we must also listen to the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">wounded child inside us. That little child needs our attention. Take time to go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">back and tenderly embrace the wounded child within you. You can talk to the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">child with the language of love. “Dear one, in the past, I left you alone. I’ve gone</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">away from you for so long. I’m sorry. Now I have come back to take care of you,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to embrace you. I know you suffer so much, and I have neglected you. But now</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I’ve learned the way to take care of you. I am here now.” If we have to, we can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cry with that child. Whenever we sit, we can spend time sitting and breathing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">with that child. “Breathing in, I go back to my wounded child; breathing out, I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">take good care of my wounded child.” When we go for a walk, we can take the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hand of our little child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We should talk to our child several times a day for healing to take place. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">little child has been left alone for a long time, so we need to begin this practice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">right away. Go back to your inner child every day and listen for five or ten</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">minutes, and healing will take place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Our wounded child is not only us; he or she may represent several</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">generations of ancestors. Our parents and ancestors may have suffered all their</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">lives without knowing how to look after the wounded child in themselves, so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">they transmitted that child to us. So when we’re embracing the wounded child</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">inside us, we’re embracing all the wounded children of past generations. This</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice doesn’t just benefit us; it liberates numberless generations of ancestors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and descendants. This practice can break the cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Writing a Love Letter</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If you have difficulties with someone in your life, you might spend some time</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">alone and write that person a real letter. You can write the letter to someone you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">see every day or, just as effectively, to someone you haven’t seen for years, or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even to someone who is no longer living. It is never too late to bring peace and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">healing into a relationship. Even if we no longer see that person, we can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">reconcile inside ourselves, and the relationship can heal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Give yourself a couple of hours to write a letter using loving speech. While</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you write the letter, practice looking deeply into the nature of your relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Why has communication been difficult? Why has happiness not been possible?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Here is an example:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">My dear</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">I know you have suffered a lot over the past many years. I have not been able</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">to help you—in fact, I have made the situation worse. It is not my intention to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">make you suffer. Maybe I’m not skillful enough. Maybe I tried to impose my</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">ideas on you. In the past I thought you made me suffer. Now I realize that I have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">been responsible for my own suffering</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">I promise to do my best to refrain from saying things or doing things that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">make you suffer. Please tell me what is in your heart. You need to help me;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">otherwise it is not possible for me to do it. I can’t do it alone</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You have nothing to risk by writing this letter. You can even decide later</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">whether to send it. But whether you send it or not, you will find that the person</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">who finishes writing the letter is not the same person who began it—peace,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understanding, and compassion have transformed you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Peace Treaties and Peace Notes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The peace treaty and the peace note are two tools to help us heal anger and hurt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">in our relationships. The peace treaty can be used as a preventive tool, before we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">utter or are hurt by words or actions that seem unkind. When we sign the peace</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">treaty, we are making peace not just with the other person but within ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The peace note can be used as a healing tool when we’re hurt or angry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">because of something someone has said or done. You can copy it and keep blank</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">copies available wherever you need it. You can use it in place of the fourth</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mantra note that you keep in your wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If someone does something that brings us suffering, we can say, “What you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">just said hurt me. I would like to look deeply into it, and I would like you to also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">look deeply into it. Let’s make an appointment for sometime later in the week to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">look at it together.” One person looking at the roots of our suffering is good, two</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">people looking is better, and two people looking together is best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Both the treaty and the note suggest waiting a few days for discussion. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can pick any night. First, you are still hurt, and it may be too risky if you begin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">discussing it now. You might say things that will make the situation worse. From</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">now until that evening, you can practice looking deeply into the nature of your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering, and the other person can too. Before that night, one or both of you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">may see the root of the problem and be able to tell the other and apologize. Then</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">on that night, you can have a cup of tea together and enjoy each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">If by that evening the suffering has not been transformed, one person begins</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">by expressing himself, while the other person listens deeply. When you speak,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you tell the deepest kind of truth using loving speech, the kind of speech the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person can understand and accept. While listening, you know that your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening must be of good quality to relieve the other person of his suffering. If</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you can, have the discussion be on a Friday evening or early on a Saturday, so</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you still have the weekend to enjoy being together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Peace Treaty</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In order that we may live long and happily together, in order that we may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">continually develop and deepen our love and understanding, we the undersigned</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">vow to observe and practice the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I, the one who is angry, agree to:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">1. Refrain from saying or doing anything that might cause further</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">damage or escalate the anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">2. Not suppress my anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">3. Practice breathing and taking refuge in the island of myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">4. Calmly, within twenty-four hours, tell the one who has made me angry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">about my anger and suffering, either verbally or by delivering a peace</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">5. Ask for an appointment for later in the week (e.g., Friday evening) to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">discuss this matter more thoroughly, either verbally or by peace note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">6. Not say, “I am not angry. It’s okay. I am not suffering. There is nothing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to be angry about, at least not enough to make me angry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">7. Practice breathing and looking deeply into my daily life—while</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sitting, lying down, standing, and walking—to see:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a. the ways I myself have been unskillful at times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">b. how I have hurt the other person because of my habit energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">c. how the strong seed of anger in me is the primary cause of my anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">d. how the other person’s suffering, which waters the seed of my anger,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is the secondary cause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">e. how the other person is only seeking relief from his or her own</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">f. that as long as the other person suffers, I cannot be truly happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">8. Apologize immediately, without waiting until our appointment, as</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">soon as I realize my unskillfulness and lack of mindfulness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">9. Postpone the meeting if I do not feel calm enough to meet with the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">other person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">I, the one who has made the other angry, agree to:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">1. Respect the other person’s feelings, not ridicule him or her, and allow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">enough time for him or her to calm down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">2. Not press for an immediate discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">3. Confirm the other person’s request for a meeting, either verbally or by</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">note, and assure him or her that I will be there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">4. Practice breathing and taking refuge in the island of myself to see how:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">a. I have seeds of unkindness and anger as well as habit energy to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">make the other person unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">b. I have mistakenly thought that making the other person suffer would</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">relieve my own suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">c. by making him or her suffer, I make myself suffer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">5. Apologize as soon as I realize my unskillfulness and lack of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness, without making any attempt to justify myself and without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">waiting until the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We vow to abide by these articles and to practice wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Signed,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the _____________ day of _________________________</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">This morning/afternoon/yesterday, you said/did something that made me very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">angry. I suffered very much. I want you to know this. You said/did:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">Yours, not very happy right now</span><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000; font-style:italic;">_________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Beginning Anew</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When a difficulty arises in our relationships and one of us feels resentment or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hurt, a good practice to try is called “beginning anew.” To begin anew is to look</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">deeply and honestly at ourselves—our past actions, speech, and thoughts—and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to create a fresh beginning within ourselves and in our relationships with others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Beginning anew helps us develop our kind speech and compassionate</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">listening because it is a practice of recognition and appreciation of the positive</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">elements of another person. Recognizing others’ positive traits allows us to also</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">see our own good qualities. Along with these good traits, we each have areas of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">weakness, such as talking out of our anger or being caught in our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">misperceptions. As in a garden, when we “water the flowers” of loving kindness</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and compassion in each other, we also take energy away from the weeds of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">anger, jealousy, and misperception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We can practice beginning anew every day by expressing our appreciation to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the people we care about and apologizing right away when we do or say</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something that hurts them. We can also politely let others know when we have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">been hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">A more formal beginning anew can be done weekly in families and in work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">situations. It is a three-part process: watering flowers, expressing regrets, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">expressing hurts and difficulties. This practice can prevent feelings of hurt from</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">building up over weeks and helps make the situation safe for everyone in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">workplace or family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Flower watering is the first part of the practice. Flower watering is simply</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">showing appreciation for the others in your family or work community. People</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">do it one at a time, waiting until they feel moved to speak. The others let them</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speak without response. It is helpful for people to hold a vase of flowers or some</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">object in front of them as they speak, so that their words reflect the freshness and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">beauty of the flowers. During flower watering, the speaker acknowledges the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">wholesome, wonderful qualities of the others. It is not flattery; we need to speak</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the truth. Everyone has strong points that can be seen with awareness. No one</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">can interrupt the person holding the flowers. Each person is allowed as much</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">time as needed, and everyone else practices deep listening. When one person has</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">finished speaking, he or she stands up and slowly returns the vase to the center</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">We should not underestimate the first step of flower watering. When we</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">sincerely recognize the beautiful qualities of other people, it is very difficult to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">hold on to our feelings of anger and resentment. We naturally soften, and our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">perspective becomes wider and more inclusive of the whole reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In the second part of the practice, participants express regret for anything</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">they have done to hurt others. It does not take more than one thoughtless phrase</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to hurt someone. Sometimes we hold on to some small resentment or regret, and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it grows because we don’t have the time to make it right. The practice of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">beginning anew is an opportunity for us to recall some regret from earlier in the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">week and undo it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In the third part of the ceremony, we express ways in which others have hurt</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">us. Loving speech is crucial. We want to heal our families and work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">communities, not harm them. We speak frankly, but we don’t want to be</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">destructive. When we sit among people who are all practicing deep listening, our</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">speech becomes more beautiful and more constructive. We never blame or argue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">In this final part of the practice, compassionate listening is crucial. We listen</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to another’s hurts and difficulties with the willingness to relieve the suffering of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the other person, not to judge or argue. We listen with all our attention. Even if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">we hear something that is not true, we continue to listen deeply so the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person can express his or her pain and release the tensions within. If we reply or</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">correct that person, the practice will not bear fruit. We just listen. If we need to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">tell others that their perception was not correct, we can do that a few days later,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">privately and calmly. Then, at the next beginning anew practice, they may rectify</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">the error themselves, and we will not have to say anything. We can end the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">practice with a moment of silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Just practicing the first part of beginning anew—flower watering—can</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">increase the happiness and communication in your family or your workplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You don’t need to do all three parts each time. Especially when the practice is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">new to you, it will work to spend most of your time on flower watering. Then</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">slowly over time, as trust is built, you can add the second and third parts. Even</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">then, don’t skip over the first. Expressing appreciation is one of the greatest</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">ways of building strong and caring relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">The Cake in the Refrigerator</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">One tool we can use to improve our communication is a cake. It doesn’t matter if</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you’re not a baker, don’t have a cake, or are gluten-free. This is a very special</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cake that is not made of flour and sugar like a sponge cake. We can keep eating</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">it, and it is never finished. It is called “the cake in the refrigerator.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">This practice was developed to help children deal with their parents’ arguing,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">but it can also be used by adults in a relationship. When the atmosphere becomes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">heavy and unpleasant, and it seems that one person is losing his or her temper,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">you can use the practice of the cake to restore harmony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">First of all, breathe in and out three times to give yourself courage. Then turn</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">to the person or people who seem upset and let them know you just remembered</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">something. When they ask you what, you can say, “I remember that we have a</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cake in the refrigerator.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Saying, “there is a cake in the refrigerator” really means: “Please, let’s not</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">make each other suffer anymore.” Hearing these words, the person will</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">understand. Hopefully, he or she will look at you and say, “That’s right. I’ll go</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and get the cake.” This is a nonjudgmental way out of a dangerous situation. The</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person who is upset now has an opportunity to withdraw from the fight without</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">causing more tension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">The person goes into the kitchen, opens the refrigerator to take out the cake,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and boils water to make the tea, all the while following their breathing. If there is</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">no real cake in the refrigerator, something else can be substituted—a piece of</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">fruit or toast or whatever you find. Preparing the snack and tea, that person may</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">even remember to smile as a way to feel lighter in body and spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">While sitting alone in the living room, the other person can begin to practice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">breathing in mindfulness. Gradually hot tempers will calm down. After the tea</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and cake have been placed on the table, perhaps all will join the tea party in an</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">atmosphere that is light and full of understanding. If one person is hesitant to</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">take part, you can coax him or her by saying, “Please come and have some tea</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and cake with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16.560001373291016px; color:#000000; font-weight:bold;">Hugging Meditation</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Some of our strongest communication does not include words. When we hug,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">our hearts connect and we know we are not separate beings. Hugging with</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">mindfulness and concentration can bring reconciliation, healing, understanding,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and much happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You may practice hugging meditation with a friend, your daughter, your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">father, your partner, or even with a tree. To practice, first bow and recognize the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">presence of the other. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and visualize yourself</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">and your beloved three hundred years from now. Then you can enjoy three deep,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">conscious breaths to bring yourself fully there. You can say to yourself:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">“Breathing in, I know that life is precious in this moment. Breathing out, I</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">cherish this moment of life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Smile at the person in front of you, expressing your desire to hold her in your</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">arms. This is a practice and a ritual. When you bring your body and mind</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">together to produce your total presence, to become full of life, it is a ritual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When I drink a glass of water, I invest one hundred percent of myself in</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">drinking it. You should train yourself to live every moment of your daily life like</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that. Hugging is a deep practice. You need to be totally present to do it correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Then open your arms and begin hugging. Hold each other for three in-and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out-breaths. With the first breath, you are aware that you are present in this very</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">moment, and you are happy. With the second breath, you are aware that the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">is present in this moment, and she is also happy. With the third breath, you are</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">aware that you are here together, right now on this earth, and you feel deep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">gratitude and happiness for your togetherness. You then may release the other</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">person and bow to each other to show your thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">You can also practice it in the following way: During the first in-breath and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">out-breath, become aware that you and your beloved are both alive. For the</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">second in-breath and out-breath, think of where you will both be three hundred</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">years from now. And for the third in-breath and out-breath, go back to the insight</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">that you are both alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">When you hug in such a way, the other person becomes real and alive. You</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">do not need to wait until one of you is ready to depart for a trip; you may hug</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">right now and receive the warmth and stability of your friend in the present</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">moment. Hugging can be a deep practice of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">During the silent hugging, the message will come out clearly: “Darling, you</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">are precious to me. I am sorry I have not been mindful and considerate. I have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">made mistakes. Allow me to begin anew.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">Life becomes real at that moment. Architects need to build airports and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">railway stations so that there is enough room to practice hugging. Your hugging</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14.40000057220459px; color:#000000;">will be deeper, and so will your happiness.</span></p>
